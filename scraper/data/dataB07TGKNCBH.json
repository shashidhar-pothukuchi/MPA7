            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Solid, well-designed quality product.I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit -- on all of my seven computers in the house -- and this is about as plug-and-play easy as it gets.Literally: (1) open plastic enclosure (2) insert 3.5\" hard drive (3) slide cover back on (4) plug the AC power adapter into the enclosure (5) connect the USB cable from the enclosure to your computer (6) press the power button on the enclosure to \"on\" (i.e. \"on\" is when the button is depressed; \"off\" is when the button sticks out a little bit). When you're connected to a computer that is on, and the hard drive enclosure power is on, the blue LED light will light up after a few seconds.Windows 7 will automatically find and install the necessary drivers for both the enclosure, and the drive (we're talking maybe 10-20 seconds here). Probably best to be connected to the Internet, just in case Windows needs to find a driver.(If you're using WinDoze 10, I will say a prayer for you -- but the enclosure works for all versions of Windows, from XP to Windows 10).If you are simply moving an existing hard drive -- one that is already in use and has information on it -- to the hard drive enclosure, that's it. You're done.NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY! If you are using a NEW hard drive, you still need to initialize the drive in order for your computer (i.e. Windows) to recognize and use the NEW drive. This applies to whenever a NEW drive is connected to a computer, and has nothing to do with the enclosure!SO, I don't want to read any \"the enclosure sucked, the drive was defective, etc.\" comments due to you not initializing your NEW hard drive. Capisce?Also remember, USB connected hard drives are NOT intended for booting your Windows computer from (if it would even let you try). So, do not install, or attempt to install, your OS onto a drive in an external USB enclosure!I bought six of these, and have already put three into service -- flawlessly.Primarily, I needed an inexpensive way to remove full-to-the-max hard drives from my computers, and still be able to access them when needed. This enclosure does this perfectly! Plus the extra bonus of now being able to connect the drives archived in the external enclosure, via USB, to any other USB equipped computer.A word about Windows XP...Windows XP will only recognize hard drives up to 2 TB in size. If you try using a hard drive larger than 2 TB with Windows XP, it won't be able to see the entire drive. The work-a-round with XP, with drives larger than 2 TB, is to partition the hard drive into multiple volumes of 2 TB or less.DO NOT try to partition a hard drive that already has files on it! You will most likely lose data, and be very, very sorry.As a rule, partitioning a hard drive is something you do with a NEW drive -- and you know why you're doing it!If you don't know why you want or need to partition a hard drive into multiple volumes, then DON'T do it.For most people, you want to create what Windows refers to as a \"Simple Volume\" (i.e. the entire hard drive is one single volume), when you initialize and format a NEW hard drive.When you initialize and format a NEW hard drive, you will be asked to choose between MBT (Master Boot Record) or GPT (Globally Unique Identifier Partition Table) when you setup the drive.Basically, if your hard drive is 2 TB or less, you should choose MBT. If your hard drive is larger than 2 TB, you should choose GPT.I have been using 1 TB, 2 TB and 4 TB hard drives in this enclosure effortlessly and with no issues whatsoever.Personally, I wouldn't put drives larger than 4 TB in an external, sealed enclosure of this type (i.e. potential heat issues on thicker multiple-platter drives), although larger drives should still work.FWIW, I have even been using one of my enclosures as a means to format new hard drives before installing them into computers. This way, I have my new drive ready-to-go before I remove an existing drive from a computer, and just pop it in to replace the drive I'm removing. Then, the drive I just removed gets transferred to one of these great hard drive enclosures and, just like that, I have an instant archive :)FYI, I'm using these enclosures as a way to archive 4 TB hard drives that I have filled full-to-the-max, so that I can fill-up even more hard drives.I'm working with a lot of video files, and this allows me to easily access files on drives that I have archived to the external enclosure.Finally, heat is just not an issue with this enclosure.My 4 TB Western Digital 5400-RPM drives idle at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (7200-RPM drives might run a bit warmer) in this enclosure.Even when I perform a complete format, lasting 10-12 hours, the drives never go higher than 100 degrees Fahrenheit -- which is well within the safe temperature zone for hard drives.TIP: If you're using this enclosure for archiving hard drives (e.g. you don't need to access the drive all the time), then just leave it off. You don't have to leave hard drives running unless you're going to be accessing them. And, a drive that's not running generates no heat at all :)Great product at an affordable price.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Was needed on short-notice and picked for the price, but didn't expect it to be THIS cheaply built. The back cover is held on only by two clips and the tracks on the side...it can come off if you handle the device at all. Also, there's NOTHING to hold the disk in besides the cover and the SATA connector. Some form of clips on the sides or opposite end would be useful for this. As it stands, you definitely do not want to turn it upright with the cover off (disk will fall out or possibly hang by/break off the connector). With the cover on, the drive lays on the cover when the unit is upright. I'll probably end up putting a few rubber bands around it to secure the cover a bit better.On the plus side, it works and they included two little foam pieces to help with noise. Assembly is self-explanatory. It's fine for a user who just needs a spot for an extra disk, but if you need something that's remotely durable, look elsewhere.A tools-required version of this with screws for the cover and to retain the drive would likely be a decent product...\n  \n",

Bought this thinking that it would work.  It doesn't.  This is a piece of crap.  It is very cheaply made.  The power button feels like it will fall off.  Build quality feels like it came out of a gumball machine.  Hooked it up and the enclosure cycles on and off.  It won't even stay on long enough for the computer to recognize the drive.  Should have stuck with my Antec hard drive enclosure that is larger, but has worked flawlessly for the past 5 years.  Next time I will remember NOT to buy the Amazon brand.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Being used to my all-metal external hard drive, this enclosure is a touch flimsier than I had expected, but that's the difference between being used to metal.  It's good enough to protect the drive.It's a basic enclosure for a 3.5\" SATA hard drive--essentially a \"no-tool\" solution:  just open the case, slide in the drive and close the case.  Done.Once I plugged into my computer (MBAir) it launched DiskUtility since it couldn't recognize the drive, but it was a new drive that needed to be formatted.  Formatting took less than thirty seconds and the drive booted up as a volume on my system.It comes with some foam padding to act as a buffer I suppose when the enclosure is on it's side, but given how the drive itself slides into the SATA connection, I just lay it flat on my table.  Comes with the power cable and USB 3.0 connection cable.Only thing I don't like is how the connections are where the power button is located.  Just seems odd to me but in no way is it a deal breaker.  For the price and ease of use, it was worth the purchase.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought this to replace an enclosure I was using for my Time Machine backup on my 27\" 5K iMac (2015).I've had a (large) number of enclosures over the years, so I'm generally used to their behaviors.  This one was weird.  It would spin up (loudly) at odd times, even though there was no Time Machine backup happening.And after I installed it I started to notice that my iMac would get slow and seem to \"hang\" at the oddest times.  Apps that normally start right up would take 30 seconds to launch, or tabs in Safari would partially load and take a minute or more to complete.  Sometimes Safari would just stop loading (but it hadn't \"stopped responding\" according to Activity Monitor) and I would have to quit it and relaunch to get the page to load.I kept thinking this couldn't be related behavior, but yesterday I figured I'd try switching back to the enclosure I had replaced (because it had a fan that was making noise).  Lo & behold, all of the problems went away!  Immediately!  And they haven't come back.I tried a similar enclosure from Orico (3.5\", tool-less installation) on my dock for my MacBook to allow me to use a 2Tb desktop drive I had sitting around, and had similarly odd behaviors from it, especially when trying to eject it so I could take my MacBook on the road.  I wonder if these very similar enclosures share similar electronics that have some bugs that need to be worked out...Regardless, I'm not using this enclosure any more.  Maybe it works well on a Windows or Linux system, but I can't recommend it for Mac.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Design:This enclosure is very easy to use, and the tool-less design makes it very easy to change different hard drives---almost like a docking station. The only strange part is that: the design seems to be up-side-down. The most reasonable placement of this enclosure should be lid-on-top, but the text printed on this enclosure suggests lid-on-bottom, very strange. The plastic material is okay, though I really prefer a metal enclosure.Quality:Pro:1. Support high capacity drives very well. Tested with a 6TB hard drive, no problem. Don't know what's the maximum capacity of this enclosure.2. Data transfer rate is very high. It seems to be limited by HDD's own speed, at least 200MB/s. Don't know the maximum speed of this enclosure.3. Perfect S.M.A.R.T. data and other metadata pass-through.4. Work on both Windows and Mac, no driver needed.Con:I suspect that the USB 3.0 cable that comes with this enclosure is bad. The cable is very short and thin. Most importantly, the enclosure keeps getting disconnected and reconnected on Windows, especially when there is a heavy workload. It is almost unusable. It is much better on mac though, and I can transfer 50-100Gs of data without encountering a disconnection in most cases. But it can still get disconnected once a while. The problem was eventually solved (both on mac and windows) after I replaced the USB 3.0 cable coming with this enclosure with a different one from another enclosure.I once considered to return this product due to the disconnecting issue, and I actually purchased another enclosure for this reason. But after I found that the problem was from the USB cable. I decided to keep this enclosure, since I love its tool-less design (I also kept the new enclosure to host my most frequently used hard drive). I hope my experience may help people who also suffer from disconnection issues on this product.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    These enclosures work well and I believe give you all you can get out of your HDD. It has a blinking blue light which is nice to have to know that it's on and being used, has a simple usb 3.0 hookup and compes with the AC/DC adapter. Pretty much plug and play.The problem is that these enclosures don't have any rubber feet, so their likely to slide off your desk. Their edges are angled so you can't easily stack these on their sides and they are really large. Granted, 3.5\" drives are large but these things seem excesive.Amazon really cut every corner as possible to make these things cheap but at what cost. The cover slides on/off pretty easily where two screws in my opinion would have been better, and rather than using the standard drive side mounts, they rely on a piece of foam to hold the drive in place.The AC/DC adapter is also a joke in that the plug is 90 degrees wrong and takes up 3 spots on your surge protect. Not a big deal if you get 1 ft extension cords but still a nuisance.Buy this if you need the cheapest way to get access to your HDD I guess, but I'd look elsewhere if you want a longer term solution to building a media server or something.P.S. I bough two and used the cardboard box it shipped in two hold two together. Works well in that I can now hold it on it's side but still pretty dissapointed here.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The enclosure seems to work fine.  I've used it several times with no problem.  There were 2 issues with it that should have been mentioned in the documentation.First, to open the sliding cover, you need to press down slightly where it mates against the rest of the box.  Small fingers lock under that edge and you have to release them by pressing down.  Once you do that it slides easily.  If you don't press down, it's almost impossible to open.The second issue is that it will not power up without the USB cable attached to it and the computer.  Given that the enclosure has wall power, that seems odd.  I put a drive in it, plugged in the wall power and pressed the button.  Nothing happened.  I ended up spending some time trying different power plugs, etc. because it behaved as if it wasn't getting any power.  Finally decided I had a dead enclosure.  For some reason I then tried it with the USB cable attached and it powered up ok.  Seems odd that it needed the USB cable for power but it did.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Old Desktops had small, (compared to today's standard 1TB) bulky 3.5\" HDD\u2019s that ran on slow SATA I, II, or worse connections. While plugged into their housing, their transfer speed was acceptable, but getting data outside the housing required working through the old computer, usually through a USB 2.0 port or an Ethernet set up. Moving multiple hundreds of GB's in this manner take hours to days, and usually fails. This device saves that time. Not only because it\u2019s transfer speed likely matches or outpaces older HDD\u2019s, because why bother transferring it at that point? The speed is sufficient to stream HD video directly from the drive without moving it to you newer device, and it\u2019s already organized the same way you had it on the old one. For the price of this device you don\u2019t have to wait for the transfer at all, thanks to the speed, it allows you to use it indefinitely as an external HDD without the old drawbacks of data rate.Pro:-Relatively cheap.-Included spacers for cushioning/ accounting for manufacture variations- USB 3.0 Speed matches or exceeds older drives, and would be acceptable on any newer mass storage device short of a network server.- A usable amount of chord to place this permanently if wanted, but no excessive that makes it a pain to move.-The power button! It\u2019s nice to be able to plug this into a network USB port and use it as an actual network drive, but turn it off without need to unplug it. Safe way to disconnect from it.Cons:-Cheaper than desired plastic. The thickness is fine, but the finish is meh. Mat finish without texture wins over textured any day. Hides scratches, too. This doesn't setract from value, but does aethieetically make this look and feel cheap.Personal Gripes:None really. Work very well and I saved my first ever desktop, a 2005 Dell XPS 400, with much more ease. As I was cleaning, the drive out I realized\u2026 I didn\u2019t need to. Just keep it. Done.\n  \n",

They all had virtually the same performance. For the money, the Amazon Basic is the clear winner. I've read reviews saying it's built poorly. But, it seemed as sturdy as any other to me. (Be sure to put the foam pad inside so the drive doesn't rattle around).The Startech was the only one that performed differently. It had the fastest large-file sequential write speed. (It was substantially better in that one test). But, the Startech's large-file sequential read (and random, small reads and writes) were not as good as the other enclosures. Excluding Startech, the rest performed virtually the same. Very small differences). So, why pay more? IMO, the only one that might justify paying more is the Vantec (because it's steel & vented.

There seemed to be no way to securely attach the disk drive to the enclosure.  It simply slides into  the connector slot.  There are no side screws to anchor the drive to anything.  The only thing that holds the drive in place from what I can see, is the enclosure cover that slides into place and loosely fits into slots on the rest of the case.  This design means there is no air space around the HDD, so it gets very hot during use.  Also on occasion the part of case cover that slides into place will come loose and the drive will also, enough that it disconnects.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The quality of the enclosure is on par with what you would expect from AmazonBasics products; basic but functional. However, there is a huge flaw that cannot be overlooked: you have to install the drive upside down. This means that when the enclosure is in the correct orientation, the drive is upside down.While it shouldn't hurt a disk drive to be run upside down, the concern is the lack of support for the drive while it's inside the enclosure. Since the drive is upside down, there's a lot of weight and pressure being exerted on the SATA header. This could lead to damage to either the drive, the enclosure, or both; SATA headers are known for being fragile. The foam pads that were included with the enclosure are not sufficient.The only way around this issue is to use the enclosure upside down. This isn't a huge problem by itself, but it's counter-intuitive and not something most people are likely to do.Aside from the issue mentioned already, the only other complaint is the fact that they decided to use a USB 3.0 Type B instead of a USB 3.0 *MICRO* Type B. The former of the two is somewhat uncommon, while the latter is backwards compatible with the extremely common USB 2.0 \"micro USB\" connection. If you lose or damage the cable that comes with the enclosure, you might have a hard time finding a replacement.\n  \n",

I was moving from another enclosure that has been frustrating me because it has a habit of going to sleep all the time, and while the previous enclosure shows that my HDD is fine, this one just did... nothing. The PC saw the enclosure, but didn't see a hard drive in it. I tried checking cables, reseating the drive, and changing USB ports. Nothing. The drive would spin up, but then pass no data to the PC.So unfortunately, this was a rare AmazonBasics miss for me. Sometimes they get hardware from suppliers that don't meet their normally high standards, and I think this may be one of those cases. I hope Amazon considers a new supplier for this item, because most of their stuff has high standards. For now, though, I'm happy with their handling of the return and will seek another hard drive enclosure for a little more money.Two stars for the hardware itself.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Well, the enclosure is plug and play, and it works. Haven't had any issues with it. The only thing I didn't realize is, is that it wasn't compatible with SSDs, so when I tried to use one it didn't work, but that's my fault for not reading all the way and isn't a huge drawback for me. Drives are easy to install and remove from the enclosure. The top is easy to remove and replace. I would have liked the activity light to be on top of the enclosure, but not a big deal. There are some foam pieces included to reduce vibration. Air flow is zero if the case is closed, but can be left open if you are not worried about any kind of interference with the drive. So if you are gonna leave the drive on for extended periods of time, I would recommend letting it breathe some and taking the top of the enclosure off here and there. But, this is definitely a good buy and would recommend it for external storage. Oh, and I use it primarily for my XB1 external storage, so it does work for those that are wondering.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought this unit because it was the least expensive, and my old external hard drive croaked. I used my old one for Wii U games and I already have a Sabrent USB 3.0 to SATA External Hard Drive Enclosure (which I highly recommend), so I took apart my old external and found that the drive was fine, but rather the USB controller died. So I figured I would try this Amazon Basics enclosure this time around, it was a few dollars cheaper.First and foremost, it did not work with the Wii U at all. The unit has an LED that turns on when connected to the system and blinks for access. This is NOT a power LED, as it only turns on when whatever it is plugged into recognizes it (for example, my home computer). It work fine on my PC, but if I left it idle, the LED would turn off and it seemed to go to sleep. This meant it would need to wake up to work again on my PC which made it seem rather slow. The Wii U would have the LED eventually come on after power up, but then it would turn off. This is the only USB storage device I have ever used that will not recognize with the Wii U.On top of my technical issue, the casing of the enclosure is very thin and does not lock in place very well. The cords are extremely short, which may or may not be inconvenient to you. On Windows, it was easy to use, but noticeably slower than my Sabrent USB 3.0 to SATA External Hard Drive Enclosure. If you absolutely can't afford a few more dollars, this will work in a pinch for basic needs, like accessing a hard drive of a dead machine. But if you can afford a few more dollars, I recommend the Sabrent USB 3.0 to SATA External Hard Drive instead. It works with game systems too, like the PS4, PS3, Wii U and XBOX One.\n  \n",

The drive made a \"click\" sound every 15 or 20 seconds, so I decided to replace it with another SSD drive and put it in a case. This one was reasonably priced and had the same features as virtually every other case, so I made the purchase so I could still use the 4TB as a periodic backup of my system. The case works as expected and I was able to transfer data back to the new SSD successfully. The only complaint I would have is that other cases that I've purchased for 2.5\" drives always offered a little space to place even thin pieces of foam around the drive to reduce shock. This case did include a couple of pieces of foam, but I'm assuming it was in case you had a thinner drive. If you have a full size, full thickness drive like mine, there is zero room for any foam, which makes for a snug fit, but leaves no extra room for any type of foam or padding.\n  \n",

Here's what I've observed.This enclosure would often freeze or even completely disconnect, especially when transferring large amounts of data at once. If I tried to write too much too the drive, it would generally cut out after a minute or two and then disconnect from my computer, along with the blue light on the enclosure turning off (like power went out, despite being plugged in with the button pushed in).Video content on the hard drive would occasionally freeze or even sometimes drop the audio for some reason.This would work in a pinch, but I would never recommend anyone buy this model until Amazon fixes the power reliablilty issues I've been facing. This enclosure was never 'good'. but unfortunately I was unable to return it due to holding up hopes that there was another issue I could resolve (such as the HDD being seated more tightly or a weight on the enclosure to hold it more firmly) I missed the 30 day window.Don't be like me.

I use them for backing up my system and recommend to my customers to have one.  If a hard drive crashes you are dead without another drive, and since it has its own power switch, if you'd end up with a virus that destroys the hard drive in the computer you have a way to get the system back.  Backing up to the same hard drive is useless if the virus corrupts your main drive.  OH another plus is that a virus can't turn on a manually switched device :)\n  \n",

When it is face up, your hdd is actually face down and there is a gap between the drive and the enclosure so you can hear it moving around a little if you flip it right side-up.  I've seen hdd enclosures with a better design but, unfortunately, not without major issues like not being able to handle larger drives (cough, Sabrent, cough, cough!).

Not a problem with SSDs as far as physical damage is concerned, but may be an issue with HDDs.The case also splits into two parts, then slides and locks into place with a tab on the inside (think batter cover), but the case is made with a cheaper plastic, so pressure may cause the case to slide open; exposing the drive.  I would have liked to see the parts be secured with small screws instead.Aside from build materials, and physical shortcomings, the device works well.

It is logical that the drive's activity led be at the back where all the electronics are encased, but I was a little disappointed because one usually expects to have visual confirmation the drive is reading or writing (lead blinking), but it is in the back and you don't see it directly and it is blue (I would have expected it to be red or amber). This is really not an issue, just thought you should be warned. All in all it is an excellent product.\n  \n",

A few years ago, I swapped the 2011 Macbook's HD with a Sandisk Ultra II SSD (960 gigs). With the old Macbook now heading to the recycling bin, I figured that it would be best to turn the internal SSD into an external one. Much to my dismay, upon trying to insert the Sandisk into the Amazon Basics enclosure, I realized that the dimensions were slightly off, making it impossible to connect the SSD to the enclosure. Drat! Further research has shown that Inateck's enclosures are compatible with Sandisk's Ultra series of SSD. If you have a Sandisk Ultra SSD, you might have better luck with Inateck.\n  \n",
