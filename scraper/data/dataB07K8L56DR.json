            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought this phone for my boyfriend expecting it to be slightly used possibly a few scratches here and there and also I was expecting to maybe have so problems with it.(being \u2018refurbished\u2019 as description says) BUT surprisingly what I received was not that!  We got a brand new never taken out of the box iPhone 6 I was pleasantly surprised.  It works great, the battery lasts a lot longer than his iphone7 that just recently crashed, and it was in pristine condition!  What more could you ask for!?! Not to mention, the T-Mobile provider (or whatever sub-brand service of T-Mobile) has great super cheap options for plans!  I was excited when I called to set it up hearing they had a $25 plan with unlimited talk text and 3Gs of data!  I don\u2019t know ANY service with that cheap of service!!  I\u2019m so glad I trusted amazon and bought this phone because it\u2019s exactly what we needed!!!\n  \n",

When we tried clicking the \u201cABC/123\u201dbutton on the keyboard, and the \u201c1/Q\u201d button it wouldn\u2019t work. We had apps on the second page of the home screen and it wouldn\u2019t let us drag the apps to the left to move them to the first page. I called Amazon to inform them of the issue and they transferred me to an Apple representative. After having me download the lastest update and resetting the phone, it still wasn\u2019t working properly. Apple said I could either send the phone to them to be repaired or take it to a local Apple store to be fixed. They scheduled me an appointment that evening with Geek Squad at my local Best Buy, since the closest Apple store was a couple hours away. Geek Squad was very friendly, and replaced the screen on my phone within 2 hours, which fixed the problem of not being able to touch the left side of the screen. It\u2019s a really nice phone and everything works perfectly now. It didn\u2019t cost me anything to have the screen replaced, so even though it was an inconvenience to take it to get fixed, I\u2019m happy they were able to fix it and that it only took a couple hours to get the phone back. I bought this phone for my daughter, because she likes using my iPhone 7, and she absolutely loves this phone. When she is playing Minecraft, the phone loads fast and doesn\u2019t lag, which is what made us decide to purchase a new phone.\n  \n",

They charger port has no protection against pocket lint, because who would keep their phone in their pocket? So it gunks up and when you plug the charging cable in - nothing. You pick your phone back up and it's as dead as it was when you plug it in.Relying on the built-in memory will leave you with a bare-bones selection of apps - half of these are \"Apple Apps\" that you cannot remove. Bottom line, you have very little space left to put all of things YOU WANT to put on your phone. You either do it Apple's way or you don't do it. As an Apple user of 25 years, I'm swithing to Windows and Android because I'm tired of being treated like a fool by Apple - and paying a premium to be their fool.\n  \n",
