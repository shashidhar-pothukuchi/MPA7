            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Size: I like that these shoes last for a long time because of the sizing. With the strap that goes around the back of the foot it fits a size smaller than the marked size (e.g., a size 9 toddler fits like an 8 toddler when using the strap around the back). Using with the strap behind the foot will make the shoe too tight if you actually need the length marked on the shoe. It is a very short strap. Once the strap makes the shoe too tight to wear, I flip the strap forward so it rests on top of the shoe and the shoe lasts though the marked size (so a marked 9 toddler will fit 8T with strap and 9T without the strap). The shoe is very wide and this fits chubby feet that don't fit into other summer shoes (sandals or flip flops).Style: I don't like the look of Crocs, I wouldn't buy any if my child's foot to wear regular summer shoes. These are a slightly more stylish verision of the regular crocs. The colors are great, true to the stock photo.Function:I love that these are easy to clean, easy to put on, great for chubby feet. These are durable, they stand up to toddler abuse.Overall:I love this as my best alternative to traditional summer shoes for my chubby toddler's feet. I love that they are durable and long lasting, but I have bought these for years so I am aware that a 9 is too tight to use strap for a size 9T length foot (so size up if you want to use strap).Photos:You can see both styled with strap on top and behind. The strap is very short. Colors. And red pair is a 8T and using strap as shown has more room to grow.***please let me know if you found this review helpful by clicking the \u201chelpful\u201d button below. Thank you!!!***\n  \n",

I will be returning these.6/13 Update....I contacted Crocks, customer service and was told that the back strap should not be that short.  They asked for proof of purchase and to have the tags on the unworn clogs and they would issue a a return authorization # and will send me a replacement for the defective ones. After that I have also purchased additional pairs from Crocks the strsp is normal.  I noticed that the ones purchased on Amazon were made in Mexico apose to the ones purchased from Crocks that were made in Vietnam.\n  \n",

But we left my sons in sun while at a pool party and when we went to put them back on a couple hours later they were way to small! They were about 2 sizes too small. He had to go home barefoot. I read on a few blogs that if you put them in hot water and put them on your feet and walk around they will stretch back a bit, but I\u2019m not gonna put my 2 year old through that. I did try hot water and pulling at them trying to stretch them out w my hands but no luck. I reached out to the company and their response was just \u201cthey tend to shrink in sun and we have no way to fix this\u201d. Not helpful. They wouldn\u2019t even replace them. These shoes aren\u2019t cheap but i keep buying bc my sons feet are so thick and chunky they don\u2019t fit in anything else. I wish company would replace and be more outspoken about the fact that they shrink in the sun. I mean, isn\u2019t the sunny days what these shoes are for? They have holes!!\n  \n",

Now if you are grown man or women who does not work in the medical field then you shouldn't be wearing Crocs.  If you do, you will be an embarrassment to your family for generations.  If this was 2007, then by all means, wear your Crocs with pride.  I did.  In fact, I wore my Crocs Off-Roads to Machu Picchu AND I hiked to the top of Wayna Pichu wearing those bad boys. Proud of that.\n  \n",

If anything, they are TOO comfortable for him (must be the foam cushion) - he never wants to wear his regular sneakers - which I don't like because although these crocs give his toes more wiggle room, the rubber toe seems to constantly cause him to trip when running outside. Adorable shoes, but since he started school this year, I prefer him to wear these when at the beach or a pool, vs. as an every day shoe he'll be running in on the playground.\n  \n",

Unfortunately, they run small for a size 9. She's 4 years old and a true size 9 in gym shoes. I ordered a 9 in these based on reviews that they run true to size or even a little big... nope! The 9's just fit. I'm hoping they get her through the summer. It's nice they come in whole sizes and not double sizes like some Crocs do. I'll know for next year to size up. Beware that after size 13 the crocband style gets enormous in width for sizes 1 and above. My older son is in a size 2, and I had to return the ones I bought for him. They were so wide that he could almost fit both feet in one shoe! No idea why they make this style so wide after size 13:( We bought him the Electro and Bump It styles which are much more narrow for Crocs anyways;)\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I ordered these for my toddler to wear while we play in the creek this summer. There are two parts to this review.1.  I ordered them in her current size thinking they would soon be snug with the strap down and then wouldn't slip off in the water. They were WAY too small. Her foot wouldn't even fit in the shoe with the strap up. There was absolute no way of putting it down. I re-ordered them two sizes up from what all her other shoes are. There is a bit a room to grow. But with the strap down they fit perfectly. I should add that when the strap is down it does not meet the heal of the shoe but comes down about half an inch in. They will fit for this summer with the strap down and then still for a while after that with the strap up.2.  Now that we have a pair that fits, they are wonderful shoes and perfect for what we wanted. She's able to go from the creek to the yard and play comfortably in both places. If the sizing had been more accurate I would have given them a  higher rating.\n  \n",

I believe the wide, firm base was what did the trick.  We have gotten her about 2 pairs per year as she outgrows them.  They get a little worn and scuffed from wear but they have never even gotten close to wearing out ... nor have we ever had any breakage.  She does love to dress them up with jibbitz that I let her pick ... her latest fad is unicorns which are really adorable on these crocs.A great selling feature for me is the ease kids have getting them on and off QUICKLY and with no frustration.  We also go to the beach a lot and they are perfect. ... especially on the hot sand ... another benefit if they get swept out in the water by a wave they float and can be rescued! !!!Crocs are the only sandals we buy for her and they are highly recommended by this grandma.\n  \n",

I noticed a lot of reviews saying they were way too small and that the strap didn't fit, and that's exactly what I thought when I first got them. However, I kind of forced them on the first couple times because my 2 year old isn't coordinated enough to walk in them without the strap, and once they were one his feet he had no complaints about them being tight. And the more he wore them, the better they fit--the strap does seem to stretch out a bit the more they're worn, so definitely don't give up on that aspect. (If the foot bed seems to fit, the strap probably will too if you give it a try). That being said, I ordered an 8 thinking it would be big (he's generally a 7), and the 8 ended up fitting just right.\n  \n",

Perfect for car rides where she tends to kick off her shoes and these save me the headache of putting laced shoes back on her every time we get out of the car because they just slip on.

While it's a tad long, it's a lot wider than the classic. Going down to a J2 probably wouldn't make any difference. Too bad, as I like the style.

We ordered a size 7 (during Amazon prime week when they were on sale) and when the first pair came, the tag said \"7\" but the shoe itself was actually a size 6. Mistakes happen, I get it. A replacement was sent immediately. Second pair came and the sizing is correct but the strap that goes around the heel is unbelievably short. No child's foot could comfortably fit with the strap around their heel. I compared it to his other Crocs that we bought at a store and there is a large difference. We had a beach trip coming up in two days and stores here were sold out, so I thought I'd give it one more shot. Amazon wouldn't accept another exchange so I had to return and re-order (meaning I lost the discount I should have had on the shoe).

Hopefully he won't need another pair until at least the end of summer.Crocs is my go to shoe for both my boys because they're easy to slip on and off, are comfortable, breathable, water proof, and easy to clean. No need to throw in the washer- just soap and water on a paper towel or use a hose ;)I love that they're affordable and have such a variety of colors and styles.\n  \n",

Our almost 3-yaer old is pushing the threshold of his 6-7 pair but he is absolutely swimming in the 8-9.  I doubt I'm the first to raise this issue but it's pretty annoying when you have a pair of great toddler shoes and then have to basically wait for a growth spurt to continue comfortably wearing the brand.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Crocs are THE all-purpose shoe for the busy toddler or preschooler. My 2 year old son puts them on himself, and they literally take us through the day. They can go from the mall to the playground, to the pool, wherever. There is no need to pack extra shoes for different activities. At the beach this summer, I saw very few young kids without crocs. One day at a popular park, the adults took notice that every  child was wearing Crocs (we had about every color of the shoes represented). Again, the versatility is key. My son trotted down the boardwalk, went on rides, and played on the beach and in the ocean--all in the same pair of shoes (and I packed about 6 pairs for him!). When the day is done we just scrub them up with the hose and set them out to dry.One thing that can be a little tricky is the sizing. Since they come in what I call \"double sizes\" (6/7, 8/9), his current pair is a little loose since his shoe size right now is a solid 8. Once in awhile one will slip off, so that is something to keep an eye on. But you don't want these to fit too tightly or the back strap will rub (he's still a bit young to wear the strap flipped up without back support).I didn't start putting him in crocs until he was about to turn 2. I know some people use them earlier than that-- it depends on the physical development and steadiness of each child. Kids who need super supportive shoes for weak ankles may not be able to wear these all day. But all in all, this is a sturdy, versatile, comfortable shoe.\n  \n",

Yes, the straps do shorten the length of the shoe but not considerably.My 6 year old normally wears a 13 or 1 in Nike/Skechers yet turns out is a 12 in Crocs. I know because I ended up taking him to the local Crocs store to try on the shoes in person. Cost of 29.99 online is comparable to store pricing.

But they are really cute enough to use as regular shoes in the summer.  They are comfortable and easy to put on and take off.  I like that you have the option of using the heel strap or not.  My daughter is between an 8 and 9 toddler shoe at the moment and this size 8/9 fits her perfectly with zero room to grow.  As she starts to outgrow the shoe we'll probably move the heel strap out of the way and get another couple of weeks use out of them before moving up in size.  She has had her Crocs for a few weeks now and they seem to be very sturdy.  I don't see any way that they will wear out before she outgrows them.  In fact, I plan to hand them down to her little cousin when she is done with them.  Bottom line, we are more than satisfied and will buy them again.\n  \n",
