            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    After 1 month of use, absolutely awesome phone, no issues at all. Battery life is great, with one charge it usually lasts all day (heavy use). The fingerprint scanner is on point, combined with the face id, the unlocking of the phone is quick. The camera is much closer to 1000$ flagships than it used to be in OP phones. I love the fact that it has a flat screen, and the 90 Hz are just something amazing, you won't want to come back to 60 Hz ever.The best you can get for the money, absolutely no complains, totally recommended.UPDATE:After one month of using the phone with total normallity with everything working fine I started to recieve a \"SIM 1 not allowed\" notification and with it all my cellular data wouldn't work. At first, I restarted the phone and the issue went away, but later the same day restarting the phone wouldn't help at all and the issue persisted, I took out the sim many times and placed it back again on the sim slot 1 and still the problem persisted. I contacted my carrier and they told me it's probable that is a malfunctioning of the phone because I then swapped the same sim card to the sim slot 2 and it is still working just fine until today. NOT SURE if it's just my device with a random issue or if it's because this is the chinnese model.I'll update if the issue appears again with the sim in slot 2.\n  \n",

In screen fingerprint reader makes unlock feel instant. Warp charge is super fast. The downsides are that 1. Battery life is only average because of the 90hz screen 2. Facial recognition is rumored to be less secure even when compared to other company's front-cam only solutions 3. No IP rating, but there's no us warranty anyway. Overall it's a great product, and I would totally recommend it to anybody who are in the market for a fast, clean cellphone.\n  \n",

Applications that felt slower on my old phone feel quick and responsive on this 7t.The screen really is beautiful, and the cutout is hardly noticeable and looks really good. I haven't used the camera extensively, but the night mode took some impressive photos that were clearer than just using my eyes alone in a fairly dark room. The OxygenOS version of the Android 10 operating system is just plain great, and everything looks clean and has great features without feeling busy or overdone.The only thing I would change is the maximum call volume (when not on speaker phone). It can sometimes feel a bit too quiet, even on full volume, though that is usually in areas where the ambient noise is louder.I would recommend getting a case for this phone, as it is very slippery alone. It does come with a clear case that may be enough, but I bought another case... just in case.I highly recommend it!\n  \n",

Nightscape is cool.  I took a picture in my great room with just a night light on in the kitchen and my wife was AMAZED that it looks like the lights are on.  I haven't had time to go into manual mode and play, but it takes much better pics than the 6T.  Battery life seems like it could be a tic worse but I keep playing with it and have installed a video wallpaper so that could take a little extra power.  OnePlus fast charger for the 6T was awesome and now it's even faster (more awesomer!) On the 7t.  And the 6T fast charger will fast charge the 7T just not as fast as the new 7T charger.I know the big feature is the 99hz screen but I thought the 6T screen was great.  I don't play action/arcade games on my phone and that application is probably where the screen would show it's meddle.All in all I am very pleased with the OnePlus 7T and would recommend it.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This is my first OnePlus phone and it really does live up to the hype. I swapped my SIM card out of my old S8 and I was instantly making calls on T-Mobile. Phone is almost bloatware free and really fast. I had a few issues with the auto brightness feature (many posts about this on the web) but the auto learn feature worked great and after a week, it now works perfect. By far the best bang for the the buck for a quality phone. Thanks OnePlus and Gotham Cells!!\n  \n",

Last week I finally made the decision to get a new phone to solve the problem completely.  I needed an Android phone with 2 sim card slots, good camera, high resolution, flagship quality with reasonable price.  After doing some research, I decided to try Oneplus for the first time.  Unlike most of the users, I kind of like the oreo lens design.  It is very cute and definitely stands out.  The phone is Chinese model with 2 sim card slots.  Battery charger is U.S./China standard.  Today is the 2nd day I have been using it heavily.  Very impressed with the 90Hz refreshing rate, Oxygen OS is pretty clean and fun to play with.  Call quality is excellent on ATT network.  Battery life (3800mA) could be better but with the Warp charge it takes a fairly short time to get recharged.Shipping was fast.  The package was wrapped very well (padded envelop in a thick cardboard box).  Phone is brand new with no sign of use.\n  \n",

When I opened the box I was happy to see that they include a phone case and a screen protector. That's where the excitement ended. I have had many phones, great phones, to not so great phones. I can say without a doubt, this is the worst experience with a phone that I have had. From all of the quirkiness (apps not installing properly, apps crashing and the phone randomly rebooting) to the horrible tech support. I called numerous times and each time, I spoke to a person that I could hardly understand, that had very little troubleshooting skills. Most of the conversation was me explaining the issues that I was encountering and the tech rep placing me on hold to speak to his supervisor. After much back and forth, and 40 or so minutes, it was quite clear that the tech rep had very little knowledge so I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told that it wasn't possible.  I'm definitely sending this back.  Horrible device and horrible tech support to match.\n  \n",
