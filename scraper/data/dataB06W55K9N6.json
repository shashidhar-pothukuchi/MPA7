I thought it was both drives that were defective and almost declared them garbage. But I decided to try new cables before returning, and I'm glad I did. Both drives now work flawlessly.So if you decide to buy this drive, you must not rely on the cable it comes with. I advise you to buy a good cable to go with it. For this, I decided to take 2 stars off.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Thanks to Amanda who shared how to format this for a current Mac. Here is a slightly updated version of her instructions:Open Disk Utilities.From the View menu, choose \"Show All Devices.\"Select WD Elements on the left side of the window.Right click and choose \"Erase\" from the pop-up menu.Create a name and choose \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\" assuming you have a current vision of OS-X.It will reformat the drive in about a minute.I followed these directions, and it was effortless. I am using this as a Time Machine backup disk. I keep it plugged into the USB hub that I connect my computer to when it is on my desk. From reviews, I see that some people have had disk failures, but I also do a cloud-based backup. But that only backs up my most recent version of each file. Time Machine gives me hourly backups for the last 24 hours, so I can recover something I've inadvertently overwritten.I was using an old Synology 212+ for Time Machine, but after moving, it asked me to reinstall, crashed in the process of doing that, and lost all my data. RAID is useless in that situation. I've thought about buying a newer, faster NAS, but that's expensive, and decided to go this route at least for the time being. Unlike the Synology, which was accessible by WiFi, this won't do backups when I take my laptop away from my desk, but I do my most critical work at my desk in any event.I bought this rather than the $5 cheaper, newer version because I prefer the rounded corners to sharp edges. The rough surface doesn't seem to show fingerprints, a problem reported by users of the shiny newer version. Amazing that 4TB can fit into such a tiny form factor and be such a reasonable price. I am delighted.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Windows 10 recognizes the drive, so if you want to manually move files from your primary drive, that's fine, I guess. What it will NOT support are the only reasons I bought an external HDD: the Windows 10 File History and System Backup features. For some bizarre reason, Windows makes you choose an external drive or a network location--it won't support backing up to an internal HDD. The trouble is that it doesn't automatically back up to this drive either. It starts to--it adds a couple of configuration files--but then just stops, with 0 actual data on the file. It may be an issue with this WD HDD and Windows naming conventions. Windows doesn't like long file paths (one of the reasons I can't really use OneDrive; I never know which files, in some sub-sub-folder somewhere, will be excluded), and saving files to this external HDD makes the file path even longer--so that every file, even if you call it \"a\" or \"b,\" will be excluded. That's a dealbreaker. They should not advertise this HDD as working with Windows 10 if it doesn't work with File History or System Backup. Merely being recognized by the system is a start, but that's not what I want to this for. If I want to do manual file dumps, I can use one of my two internal HDDs. Not worth the time or aggravation.\n  \n",

I had to go through deleting games I played from time to time just to play new ones. Now, I can make the choice of letting it stay there for a while since I have the space.Set up was SUPER EASY on PS4 as it already has the settings to format it. Not only that, it was quick in the formatting process. It's such a relief to know that I have so much extra space now. 500GB to 2TB? That's a nice jump I'll say.Lastly, the price is right in my range of what I was looking for. I didn't want to go too expensive, but I knew I wanted something good. I knew about this external hard drive because of my roommate. He got it during Black Friday (I completely missed out; I regretted it) and has no issues out of it. The opportunity came for me to purchase it for myself and got it here at a nice price.Overall, I definitely recommend it!\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have read some other reviews on this product that have made many comments about it not being compatible from machine to machine or Windows version to Windows version and I would like to say that I am happy to not have a clue what they are talking about. I bought the 3TB version and this puppy is as easy to use as advertised and quieter than a church mouse.My Tasks: I am attempting to back up all of my personal files as well as a few business ones so I am continually taking this external hard drive from one PC to the next. It is truly plug and play and those that say moving from different Windows versions gives them trouble must be doing something different than me. I did exactly as instructed and just plugged in the hard drive and then opened \"This PC\"/\"My Computer\" and it showed up just like a thumb drive does. I dragged and dropped my files and presto everything is good.Background: I work daily off two HP's and one Surface Pro. I have one HP (work computer) that runs Windows 7 and the other HP (personal) as well as the Surface Pro (work) runs Windows 10. There was no lag and no delay in the different systems with regard to picking up the hard drive via USB. But, the one thing I did notice when connecting to my Windows 7 work HP is that it did not want to read when plugged in via \"USB extender\" (I have 2 USB ports on this computer and several items that run off USB connections so I picked up a generic USB extender from Amazon a while back) like a normal thumb drive does. Instead, it would only read when directly connected to the USB on the laptop. Maybe this is something some other people are doing (not giving it a direct connection). Now, I did not have to google, I did not have to install updates, I did not have to format, or change the drive in any way other than how it arrived in the box. I simply used my many years working on computers (I am 42 and worked on a computer since 2004 in an office setting with only On The Job Training/learning as you go) to employ my common sense and the mantra of  \"if at first you don't succeed consider that the problem might be 'user error' or a PEBCACK (problem exists between chair and keyboard) issue\". In fact, I have discovered that most of the time when something doesn't work like its \"supposed to\" it is usually something I have done wrong by over thinking it.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've been subscribing to an online/cloud backup company for years. This year, the annual renewal price went up significantly, causing me to look for alternative backup ideas. I knew about external hard drives but they used to be a lot more expensive; I was surprised to see how much they've come down in price since I last looked at them. The price of this 2TB hard drive was less than one year of the online cloud service!The company I was using backed up *everything*, but that isn't really necessary for me. I really only need to back up my photo archive, documents, and my genealogy database. This was the perfect solution. It arrived today and it's amazing how small it is, it could fit into a small purse or the pocket of any bag. It's extremely simple to use, there's no software to install, you simply plug it into your computer's USB port and voila!; a new drive option appears. With it plugged in, you can save things to that drive, or copy and paste items using File Explorer, which is what I'm doing in order to have a spare copy of important items. I purchased the 2TB size, which gives me about 1.81TB usable space.There's so many benefits of this for me: 1. It's cheaper than the online backup company I was using and no more annual subscription expense, 2. It's small enough to take places, so I can share photos and files when I visit family without trying to fit things on a thumb drive, 3. the backup company only covered a single device for the price I paid, now I can back items up to this drive from my desktop AND my laptop, 4. it can also serve as extra storage space if needed, which I realize is why most people probably buy it to begin with, and 5. The online backup software really bogged down my computer as it constantly backed up files, now that annoyance is gone.I love this thing. Zero complaints so far, it's extremely easy to use and worth the price.\n  \n",

It is a physical moving disc and not an SSD, so you'll need to be careful and treat it like you would any other hard drive.It is an example of plug and play functionality at its finest. Simply unbox the drive, plug it in, format it appropriately, and you're good to go.  No software or setup needed.  The drive is small, portable, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  This is a no frills drive, but if that's what you need then this is your drive.  You could use this as a solid backup drive, or just adding storage to your existing computer.In our home, I use it as a network attached storage device plugged into the USB port in our home router, and multiple users can access the drive quickly through the network for our file storage needs.  This is my second one, as we've already filled our first 2TB unit I bought several years ago.It is portable enough where you could unplug and drop it (carefully) into a bookbag or briefcase to transport lots of data to and from school or work if you've exceeded the ability to do so on regular flash drives.Overall it is exactly what I was looking for - A quick way to add storage to our home network.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because of the very short cable that comes with the drive. (1ft).  If using the supplied cable, that length really limits where you can put the drive.  However, any USB 3 cable will work i you have a longer one handy.  Great drive overall.\n  \n",

I had an HP 1T external hard drive, but it's chock full. So anyway, I have a few things to say about the set up that may help someone else who's replacing a smaller external hard drive, and/or whose PC or laptop isn't the lastest OS. (1) when I plugged the new Elements 2T hard drive into the very same USB that the old HP external hard drive was plugged into, my new Elements hard drive began beeping.  WTH? The complete lack of instructions had me in a frazzle. The box says Plug And Play, right?(2) the new Elements hard drive wasn't being recognized either in Computer. (2) I unplugged it from that extension port and plugged it directly into a USB port of the laptop. No beeping. (3) Still, when I went to the Backup and Restore feature, the old HP was still the recognized external hard drive, although is said disconnected. (4) Tinker tinker. Couldn't find anything that said \"start backup now\". ??? (4) Went back to Computer. Still not recognizing the new Elements hard drive. (5) Went back to Backup and Restore....VOILA! Finally the new external hard drive was recognized and the back up was in progress. The only thing I can say is, IT TAKES A FEW MINUTES for an old laptop, an old OS, to get with the program. (5) Old laptops have USB ports that are kaput. That's why I'm using a USB adapter, one end plugs into an operable USB port, the other end allows 4 USB's to be plugged in. I don't think this new ELEMENTS hard drive liked my adapter. It wants it's own port. The old HP hard drive didn't care. (6) So now been 4 hours, and my laptop is halfway backed up. Afterall, there's at least 1T of stuff to Back up.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    First off, I'm not a total idiot with electronics. I've purchased, formatted and used dozens of hard drives over the years. I ordered this WD 5TB drive recently (Jan 10, 2020). The mini-usb cable would not go into the drive. I fussed, I cursed, to no avail. I tried putting its cable into a 4TB WD drive I bought last fall, and it went in on 2nd try. I tried the 4TB cable on the new 5TB, and it went in.  I went back to the new cable on the new drive.... and it went in, if a little reluctantly.Not feeling real good about this, I hooked it to my 2015 13\" Retina MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.14.6 (Mojave).  I used Disk Utility to format the drive, then tried to partition it into 4 volumes. After the 1st volume, it failed, the Black Screen of Death (kernel panic). Reboot, try again. This time I get 3 volumes created before BSoD. Reboot. Try once more, and it successfully completes. Boot machine up and start migrating 2 volumes from 4TB drive to new 5TB drive. First works perfectly. The 2nd volume is a disk image created with Carbon Copy Cloner, which I am also using to copy the disk. At the end, when it tries to resize the partition for a boot sector, I get the BSD again.  I call WD who say to call Amazon, who say to ship it back. They send me a new one.The new one arrived today. Again, the cable will not go in. The 4TB cable will go in with a little fussing, and the new cable will go in the 4TB drive, but I can not get the new cable in to the new drive. This time I notice that the port for the cable in the new drive is recessed further and to the side than the 4TB drive is. This makes me think the internal port is actually to blame.  I call Amazon again and this time they say I should just return it and they will refund me. They will only do a replacement once.I would NOT recommend purchasing the 5TB drive until someone says it's all clear to do so. You won't lose any money, but I wasted a lot of time partitioning and transferring the data before it failed. No one was any help in understanding why partitioning (and resizing) volumes would result in a BSD.The sad thing? I paid $99 for the one I originally ordered, and I see the price is up to $109. Sigh.I love WD external drives.  I currently have 4 of them as well as an 8TB desktop external, and have had dozens over the years. I have never had a problem with any of these WD drives until now. I suspect I just got a bad batch...If the cable doesn't go in firmly and easily, JUST SEND IT BACK! Amazon says they are reviewing them now.\n  \n",

In terms of storage and speed, it gets the job done pretty well, but the enclosure feels hollow and the plastic feels cheap and flimsy.  Even the edges are rough and sharp.

It's quiet, and that's fine.The problem is that this device consumes a LOT of USB power. So much, in fact that a Raspberry Pi 4, with an external 3-amp power supply, won't boot with this power hog attached. And, due to the high power consumption, it runs quite warm, too.I have a similar Seagate 5GB external drive installed on another system and it is working just fine in an otherwise identical application.I wish I'd done just a little more homework, and remembered all the times I've regretted purchasing WD consumer-grade junk.Now I'm in the position of just having to bite the bullet and purchase a different drive with lower power requirements or insert a self-powered USB hub (adding yet another item to fail!) to the composition.Fool me once, shame on you.

I immediately copied a folder containing over 10,000 JPG pictures, spread across 32 folders within the top level folder. The copy took about 6 minutes, averaging almost 100MB/s. See the photo which is a screen capture I took just as the copy completed. You can see the transfer rate was very consistent. I should mention that the source folder was stored in an SSD (M2).My first impression is very positive, especially for the price. The drive is a bit chunky, but seems well made. If anything crops up to change my opinion I will revisit this review, but for now I am very happy with this drive and would buy it again.\n  \n",

I do hold WD responsible for making assertive claims that this drive is compatible when it doesn't behave like a real drive should.Step 9) Set up WD.com account and registered product for support. Not so easy. After setting up my account online and registering my product, I created a case for my issues. Within 10 minutes of being on the My WD Portal, my account information and registered product was no longer available to me. I now am unrecognizable to their system which makes no sense at all other than someone on the other end chose not to deal with my case and deleted it as well as my registered product. Quite frustrating. If no response within 24 hours, I will be returning back to Amazon.CONCLUSION:After running troubleshooting tips offered via WD, I am reluctant to keep this drive. I am asking others who have professional level experience to offer, I do realize, free pro bono tech advice, to me and possibly others seeking advice, into areas of Windows OS root fixes and ultimately forcing windows 10 to permanently let end user optimize this external drive much like an internal drive is used, as well as create original file backups as well to the WD Element HD? It just seems to me that  Microsoft is not making it easy to allow me to make system wide OS tweaks like I was able to on older platforms. Such a drag. But then again, I could be over stepping here as I have no technical professional level advice to offer for the crazy world of windows 10. All I know is I just want to be able to play my online games and Win 10 really dropped the ball here. Need I mention the graphics problems facing the windows 10 online gaming community? I didn't think so :/ Not all blame should be on WD here as I have been a lifelong fan of WD products. Microsoft, wake up, listen to the complaints of millions who have purchased, or were forced to switch over, to your Windows 10 junkware.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought a couple of 2TB WD Elements to use as backup drives for Youtube and DVD productions. Each set of production files averages about 40GB with individual file sizes anywhere from a couple of MB to 8GB for the DVD iso files. My computer system uses an internal Samsung 1TB SSD as the system drive which is where the production files reside when I am working on them. When production is complete I copy the approximately 40GB of files to the WD via my USB 3.0 port. The transfer rate averages a steady 110-120 MB/s with no intermittent slowing..I initially purchased the Seagate 2TB Backup Plus as backup drives but found that they had a periodic rhythmic slowing of the data transfer rate throughout the transfer of the files. My guess is that the Seagate suffers from a caching issue that is not present with the WD Element. Needless to say the Seagates were returned (thank you Amazon for your great return policy).A word of caution here to those who complain of the WD drive dropping off intermittently. The USB cable provided with the WD drive is a VERY tight fit so you meed to push with considerable force to seat the cable fully into the drive housing. Failure to insure that the cable is fully seated is most likely the cause of the drive intermittently dropping off.Overall, I don't think you can go wrong with the WD Element when looking for a backup drive. It's speed is fine.\n  \n",

So now that I have read the reviews and almost a quarter of these are 1 star :(, I am not feeling so good.  On top of that for the price I really could have gotten a nas quality \"internal\" disk and used my sata to usb cable and got the same capacity with a significantly higher quality drive for an extra $10.  What was I thinking, *kick*, *kick*, *kick*.  The drive is still \"working\" for me but I think I made a mistake on this one.

A new Time Capsule is more than $300 and not in my close to the holidays budget. The Elements drive was under $100.No issues using the Elements drive so far. The only close to negative thing I could say about it is I can hear it when it's running. Never had that with the time capsule but you get used to it.The other thing about this drive is I feel confident that I can pick this up and go without worrying where to put it. We live in a hurricane zone and every time we've had to evacuate I've had to lug the big (old) time capsule out with me. The Elements drive can fit in my go bag, wrapped in a sheet of bubble wrap and I'm feeling okay about that. I do have some concerns about how delicate it feels, but I'm hoping that's more about how looks and less about how it holds up.Some of the other reviews say the drive stopped working after a few days or months.

I also had the issue that when I wanted to eject it from my desktop ('right' clicking it so the options to eject would show) so that I could disconnect it from my laptop, it said that no ejection could happen because it was in use yet I had nothing open!

It freezes my Photoshop programs and takes forever to load even though I have enough free laptop space on its own and on the hard drive. I thought it was a virus but I have run programs to detect it and NOTHING. Everything shows up as being fine. I thought this was going to last me which is why I bought the 4TB one but it only lasted me 5 months. I also only use the drive like 1 week per month since it is only for photoshop projects. Truly afraid that everything will just delete..\n  \n",

I love having stuff on the hard drive - you know where it is, and there's no issue in putting it away in the same place.  We live in a small apartment, so storage space is critical.  Storing photos, CDs, and DVDs on a hard drive is great.  The physical media is now in boxes elsewhere.

It took a couple of days for them to review my request and they emailed me to confirm that they will take responsibility to recover the data I lost as a result of the crashed disk. They contracted DriveSavers to restore my data, and after a couple of weeks they sent me back a new WD harddrive with my data restored. The process was very smooth and easy. So, if I can't say much about the quality of their drives, I can definitely say that they have good customer support! I raised my rating from 1 to 3 stars - all for customer service!Original review:I should have listened to other reviewers with the same problem that said this hard drive died on them unexpectedly after a couple of months. I thought it must be a random glitch and can\u2019t be happening often, given it\u2019s an SSD drive and doesn\u2019t have fragile parts like fans, etc. that make regular hard drives not as reliable. So I purchased this drive on January 8, set it on my desk, saved all photos and videos from my 11-year old Seagate hard drive, then put it back in its original box and set it in a desk drawer. I did not touch it again until March 30, when I had a free day and decided to dedicate it to backing up 10 years worth of family photos and videos to google photos. I took out the WD 2 TB hard drive, plugged it into my desktop, and opened google photos. But before I could select the folders to back up the WD drive disappeared, and an error message popped up: \u201cerror: fatal hardware failure\u201d. The disk still had the light on but was wheezing and making other noises inside. I tried to plug it into another computer, tried to leave it overnight, tried to use data recovery software but alas, any of our PCs can\u2019t see it anymore.Amazon provides tech support but for 60 days only and we are now outside of that window. The manufacturer said that because of the fatal hardware failure error it is unlikely that we can recover the data now, but we should pay one of the data recovery companies to try. They will replace the drive. But wow! I do t ant to have another one of these!! The quality control is obviously lacking if my Seagate drove worked for over 10 years, including travel and other rough handling, and this thing died on the second use? It was never dropped, it doesn\u2019t even have a scratch on it!So, if you want to save yourself a headache of losing all your family videos and photos or other data, stay away from WD hard drives!\n  \n",

You plug it up via a USB cable that comes in the box and then within a few seconds the PS4 will recognize it as expandable storage and from there you have to let your PS4 format the drive which took approximately 30 seconds for the 4tb one. All in all it is a very painless process. The drive so far works great, it doesn't have ground breaking read/write speeds so if you're looking for something that would speed up load/boot times for games I'd look somewhere in the realm of the SSD external. However, for the price and from what I've seen performance wise so far, you can't beat this deal.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought this during Prime Day for a sweet sale with the 3TB version that includes a 32GB flash drive. This will be my fourth WD Elements drive (none have failed on me yet and I can only hope it will continue to be that way!).For this review I'd like to point out a few things that could be relevant to the next person who considers purchasing it..1. If you're considering the portable drive for the purpose of shucking it, DON'T BOTHER! While the Elements series do not contain hardware encryption (compared to My Passport), the drive inside does not use a standard SATA connector and it will only be a waste of time outside of curiosity. On top of that, the warranty will likely be voided.2. Transfer speeds are 2-3x faster compared to USB 2.0. Because this portable drive receives all its power from the USB port, the transfer rates are a little lower compared to the desktop version. I tested with about 1 TB of files transferred over and was able to get between 50-90MB/s (desktop version can go as high as 140MB/s). All while remaining silent.3. Try not to confuse TERABYTE with TEBIBYTE. Drive manufacturers tend to use the former for their storage capacity, while the operating system reports the latter. For example, actual space reported after formatting will be 2.72TB (for the 3TB model). But if you right click on your drive and go to Properties, under the General tab the capacity reports a little over 3,000,000,000,000 bytes (for the 3TB model).4. You CAN plug in a micro-USB 2.0 cable to this thing and it will still power up normally. While I can't question the reason for this (since it will be limited to USB 2.0 transfer speeds... on a large capacity drive), this should be avoided at all costs unless it is that really desperate moment (maybe you lost/damaged the original cable and needed a quick solution while a replacement is arriving, etc...). On the reverse side, you can plug the included cable with into a USB 2.0 port (only do this if you have no other choice at the moment). Computers made within the last several years comes with USB 3.0 ports so using that is pretty much a no-brainer.5. If you did purchase the HDD + Flash Drive combo, it comes with a Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32GB flash drive (USB 2.0). Again, the combo was on sale during PRIME Day and it was a better deal compared to the other options.This is still a good drive and should be great for any laptop user. Just make sure you're getting the most out of it by using a USB 3.0 port. It's compact and lightweight for portability.\n  \n",

Right out of the box you can drag files to it, sure, but if you every try to delete the volume and reform it, you'll probably have a brick on your hands.Note the firmware version is from december 2006...  Note also that -- maybe I somehow missed it but there is no newer firware available for it.Note also that I discovered all this by trying to use the drive as a backup drive with Acronis. Acronis has a feature that places a small partition on the external drive that you can boot from.  This gives you enough of an OS to run acronis recovery and recover your system. I've actually had to do this once - it works. But with this WD drive, the automatic but required re-partitioning and formatting can't be done.  Afterwards, I tried everything to reformat manually, but no success.Then I purchased a similar 2T drive from Seagate. Ran Acronis. All good. easy, no problem.This is the second time in 3 years I've bought a WD product that has had a fatal flaw that was not at first apparent. Ouch.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I ordered a 2TB WD Elements HHD in September and received it promptly. Things were looking good. When I opened the box, I noticed a couple of small, clear, plastic pieces fell out of the package. I gave it no thought and continued to unwrap the hard drive. I plugged it into my Mac and it wouldn't read. I then plugged it into my PC, no deal. I examined the plastic casing that it arrived in - inside the box - and realized that the pieces that had fallen out were from this internal plastic casing. I knew something was wrong. I tried repeatedly to install the hard drive, with no luck. At this point, I needed proof from a third party. I called Western Digital for tech support and was on the phone with a representative within minutes. After being given vague instructions, being treated like I didn't know what I was doing for about 15 minutes, and searching how to inspect the hard drive online, we finally arrived at a conclusion: the hard drive experienced a fatal error. The details were only accessible on my PC, however, which also indicated that the drive itself was manufactured in 2006. needless to say, a 13 year old piece of equipment was mishandled somewhere along the process - possibly a return item shipped to me as \"new\" - was successfully returned and I had my refund the next week. I wouldn't order it again but I would probably purchase a WD product through a store front retailer.\n  \n",

It takes fantastic photos, worlds better than any phone.Anyway, we use Google photos to store the photos and videos (compressed JPG and MP4 format) to the cloud. I got this WD portable hard drive to store the original RAW, uncompressed MP4/4K, and uncompressed JPG files from the SD drive. On first plugging in the drive using the provided cable, the Chromebook read the drive, but I reformatted it just to be safe. It ended up with 1.8 TB of useable storage space. Copying the files was easy using the built in Files app on the Chromebook. I made folders by the month and file format on the hard drive and copied the files over. We had  a lot of photos from several trips so copying took a while, but it never stalled or died or gave me an error message. With 128 gb of files one has to be patient....this has been worth the investment.  We now have original, uncompressed files in a very accessible and organized format. I will now move the files over after every big trip so I don't have to do 128gb at a time..... Very easy to do.  And now, if we want to print out enlarged prints or edit photos or view 4K videos, we can easily do so.  I have repurposed an old Case Logic GPS case to hold the drive and cable when not in use.  The drive itself doesn't come with a case. I highly recommend this drive!\n  \n",

This drive is a huge improvement over precious ones I've had though.USB 3 changed the game. I don't need a stupid power supply anymore and this drive can even fit in most pockets. It's also quite far compared with even my older 5tb larger drive. This may be due to the drive speed which I believe is 7200 for this model. My older drive is a 5600, I think. In any case, transfer speeds are great.It's a great price even without the sale I got mine on, too. 4tb is very worth the price.If you need a lot of storage, get this! It's particularly useful if you have an Xbox One. Great to just plug and play with at least 4x the space you already have if not 8x.

Great for any one looking to easily expand their computers/console storage or just need an easy way to take a lot of files on the go.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I purchased the 2TB as extended memory for my PS4.  It was extremely easy to set up and works flawlessly - I have not noticed any delays or issues playing games installed on the drive.  I download most digital games directly to the drive and its just as fast as downloading to the PS4's internal memory.  Its nice to not have to delete games when you want to play something else.  So far, I'm quite happy with this and would recommend.If you are considering purchasing this for use with your PS4 gaming console, here are the installation instructions:1) Plug in the external drive to PS4 USB port2) Go to Settings > Devices > USB Storage3) Select the external memory from menu and click X on the controller4) Format as Extended Storage.That's it.  The PS4 will format the drive and ask if you want to use the external drive for downloads.To move games or other applications from the internal memory to the external memory, follow these steps:1) Settings > Storage > System Storage > Applications2) Select the game/application you want to move, press the Options button on the controller then select Move to Extended Storage.  At this point you will have the option to select multiple applications if desired.  Then click Move.It may take several minutes depending on the size of the application to transfer it to the external drive.The application/game will still show up in any folders, etc so nothing really changes in terms of appearance or access to the game.  You can access the external storage by going into Setting and selecting Storage - you'll see both the internal and external drives listed.Remember - if you want to remove the drive don't just unplug it (this is true for use on a computer as well).Go to Settings > Devices > USB Storage > select external drive then choose Stop Using this External Storage.I hope this helps anyone considering using this drive for the PS4.  Again, so far its worked flawlessly and I would definitely recommend.\n  \n",

So I restarted it and to my dismay  I hear nothing but click click click coming from the hard drive,not responding,this can't be happening, So I removed and restarted it about 3 times ,finally no clicking..Now I am transferring  over 300 gigs of family pictures and important stuff to my old one for  temp safe keeping..So remember I the word Hold . well this Hard drive was last updated in August . so with today its only been ran 3 times..I am so upset be careful  if you buy this.it could be a fluke or they have downed their quality\n  \n",

I had about half a dozen multi-GB flash drives, some 64-GB micro SD's, an old 40-GB hard drive, a few dozen DVD-R's for storage, and a 250-GB SSD laptop.This beast gladly put all that gear in one place, looked at me, and laughed saying \"What else you got?\" And by George, I had nothing else. I greatly overestimated my storage needs and underestimated the technological advancements made in mass media storage.Speed wise, I don't know how it compares. I did everything I needed over the course of a couple days. Is there something better out there... maybe, but this was way more than I actually needed. Highly recommended. There's a reason it was an Amazon Pick.\n  \n",

Except it's transfer speeds on a USB 20 is a little bit faster than I expected. Added 1.83 TB of files almost non stop coping in large File folders. Smallest about 50GB & largest 800 GB. I also set my drives on bottle caps for air flow. If you do the same make sure the caps & drive don't slide around..Original review 3 star:Arrived in tact in a bubble bag & rigid cardboard store shelf box. Plug & play add a few GB of movie files to test it. All as expected. (My USB 2 max 50 MBS) it topped out at 34 MBS. Drive is USB 3 backwards compatibile with 2.0PROBLEMS Wouldn't disconnect with Win 7 & Quad core 2.3GHZ.In use light WOULD NOT GO OUT. Even after 10 minutes AFTER PC was shut down..I have 17 USB hard drives Toshiba, And mostly Seagate. They all stop the in use light a few seconds after shut down. Only one drive Won't disconnect from Win 7 (a Seagate refurbished replacement of the newest Seagate drives). The new drive began its rapid demise by not disconnecting..I've returned/exchanged for a new drive same day I received it. Hopefully that was a fluke of mass production.

So, what to replace it with?  Read a bunch of reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, and decided on this one.  I have a 2011 Mac, so it had to be something that doesn't require a Thunder port, or some other exotic interface.  I'm no computer genius.  Let's get that out there up front.  I wanted something that had sufficient capacity for all the work documents, photos, music, and whatever else, all in one place.  And if it has a small profile?  All the better.Plugged this in and waited... Cannot read disk.  :(  Ok, now what?  Right!  Reformat!  So, I did.  That took a few minutes, then I tried again.  Success!  Click click, and now Time Machine is silently backing up to this new drive.  Perfect!  It takes up almost no space (slightly larger than a deck of playing cards), doesn't use an electrical outlet, doesn't whir and grind next to me (as the former backup disk did), and I'm backed up and ready to go in case of emergency (or the inevitable replacement computer).I've had this now for a couple of weeks, and I can say I'm very pleased.\n  \n",

It is the same size as the WD Passport drives.  It's the first over 2TB drives owned.  It's great having a greater amount of space rather than multiple smaller drives.  The portability is good as well.  Previous, but not all, WD Passport drives came with a felt carrying case for easy portability along with some protection of the device.  This drive does not come with a protective pouch.  It easily installs and is recognized so no drivers are necessary.  The price was good at the time of purchase.I just wish FedEx or UPS delivered.  Amazon used to have a place or would invite to comment on shipping or packaging.  Since they are hiring anyone to deliver packages I watched the delivery person literally toss the drive from about 8 to 10 ft away onto my porch so I hope this drive doesn't fail as a result of any potential damage.

I should have paid more attention to  the USB3 specs and the 5400 rpm drive speed.  If this drive is operating up to it's ratings, it's slooowww relative to what I was used to.  Maybe I can swap the internal disks with the Thunderbolt box.  hmmm.  Time Machine has taken 18 hours to get to the 12% mark encrypting the drive.  Otherwise, I like the drive.  Everything else is great.  It is easily portable, quiet, and nice looking.  Plug and play.Downgrading my rating.  I've never had a problem like this on a modern external drive.  It took 7 days to encrypt this drive through TimeMachine (TM).  The next TM backup (5 gigs) was estimated at 21 hours.  Perhaps the drive is defective?  Perhaps USB 3 is dysfunctionally slow? Perhaps the cache is too small?  Perhaps it's great for single small files but a large file such as the TM file (or Photos files, or Music files, or any other large bundles) are too big?  I really don't know why it's a problem, but this drive simply will not work for me.  I can't imagine that anyone would be happy with these speeds.\n  \n",

I'm using it to back up over 1000 movies, documentaries, and tv shows from an internal 2.5\" 4TB hard drive in my desktop computer and it's been rock solid.The external matte black plastic case is absolutely beautiful and the chamfered gloss edges on top is a nice touch with a nod to detail. Western Digital has a reputation for reliability and top quality which is the primary reason I purchased this drive but the external case is so attractive I would have be tempted to get this drive just for the case alone.  Luckily, I didn't have to make any compromises here, the drive is both reliable and attractive and the cost very affordable.Final verdict... I highly recommend to anyone who may have a need for a reliable external hard drive with a wink to style.\n  \n",

I opened the package to find the original hard drive box was already opened and the hard drive appeared to be used. The hard drive was loose inside the packaging and there was no user manual. There was a piece of shoddy parchment/packaging paper in there that was crinkled and folded. The wire was shoved in the box next to the hard drive. It appeared as though someone got this, took it out of all the original packaging and then returned it. When I plugged the drive in, it would not register on my computer (windows). I contacted Amazon to see about getting a return and could barely understand the woman on the line. She did not seem to understand that I wanted to return the item and attempted to troubleshoot the item. This would have been fine if the item was new, but it was used and I did not pay for a used item. After about 30 minutes of talking to this woman and going through multiple steps trying to troubleshoot, the line disconnected. The woman could not grasp that the drive was not showing up on my computer, or in the disk manager so we went in circles over and over. I did some research on Google and eventually figured out how to fix the issue. Apparently the drive I had bought, which was supposed to be new, had been formatted for some other computer system. I worked through the process and re-formatted the drive to Windows. Now the drive works fine...The reason for the one star was the crappy customer service and the fact that I received a used item.
