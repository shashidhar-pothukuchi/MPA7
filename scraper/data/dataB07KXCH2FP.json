If you watch a lot of movies or videos on your phone it's the best phone you can have.Other than that, you can expect all the other flagship quality features from the phone like the camera and battery life. The phone is very light, very comfortable to use. The UI is cleaner as well. You can not go wrong with this phone.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    As of now if u want a perfect phone ... just go for it!Camera is mindblowing.(if u see it with a phone camera perspective)Sound quality through speakers and 3.5mm jack is great tooFingerprint reader is a 8/10  it is quick but u need to place the finger very accurately on the sensor. But overall it works fine ... turn on face and fingerprint lock together and u r good to goGaming ... it's simply free flowing...pubg is a joy on this device ...ya iPhones shine there with 1/2 of a second...they are faster in gaming...no big deal though.Call quality  is great.  Network reception is awesome too.Battery life...on a typical usage. It would last a day.  I started using it at 9:00am with 95% of battery and it lasted till 9pm for meThe usage includes  30 -40 mins of gaming camera usage other social networking apps and everything else which u would ever use on a typical day.I faced a bit of heating. not a lot but it gets slightly warm on the back if battery is low and usage is heavy.  But that too is not. a huge thing...\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A beautiful phone imagined by Samsung. They have  always been making very practical phones and S10 is no different. I have got the S10 varient. There are a few things yu have to keep in mind before buying it.This is a flagship device with mediocre battery life. Lasts 1 day with medium usage. Camera and other things are spot on. Usage is smooth is monor stutters here and there. They are still working on stabalising this phone completely.My point : If yu want a bigger battery go for the S10+ or else sticking with the S10 will be fine.\n  \n",
