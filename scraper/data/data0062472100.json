Just a big blob of uncooked ideas.  Just trying to explain my feelings , never said I WAS A WRITER, so I am sorry if I disappoint . At least I didn't take your money for some squalid little story  with a lot of built up  expectations. Just upset I passed the return deadline , It took me this long to bring myself to read to page 37... and I know this is childish but BLEAH\n  \n","title":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Badly written and convoluted\n  \n"},{"author":"Not found","date":"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2020","id":"amzn1.account.AFTK7E45JC5Z7CDDYBPYZRPKNLZQ","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFTK7E45JC5Z7CDDYBPYZRPKNLZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","rating":5,"text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    In a postscript Neil Gaiman acknowledges that other writers have explored similar themes, and many certainly have, but Gaiman‚Äôs take is imaginative, compelling, and highly readable. Just to single out one virtue: Gaiman has the gift of a fine poet to select a simple image that can express complex truths, so the quarters that Shadow uses to practice his endless coin tricks morph into the golden sun/silver moon of nature while keeping us focused on the illusory quality of ‚Äúreality,‚Äù the ubiquity of the grift.
