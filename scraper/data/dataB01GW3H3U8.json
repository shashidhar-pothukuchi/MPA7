Stick failure and a broken trigger in the first two, the original black ones. I had higher hopes for this one but stick drift after only having it a couple of months. It's ridiculous there's no more quality in official Microsoft products than this. I'd shell out for the Elite controller and come out ahead on money but from what I gear they eventually break down as well.\n  \n",

I bought this specifically to use via Bluetooth on a custom gaming pc (paired with an ASUS Z270e mobo), and it worked well with no setup required beyond the initial pairing under system settings.  I have noticed that its connection time varies, and that it tends to connect fast when I point it right at my tower (I have it underneath my desk), but that's not worth losing a star.  Once it's connected, I haven't had a single drop, and I'm happier having this to use on certain games than the standard keyboard and mouse.\n  \n",

The finish isn't as smooth as the older models, but I like the soft texture feeling. Easily sync'd with my Xbone and my chargeable battery pack fit perfectly. It is really nice to have a new controller that doesn't continue to walk when I release the thumb stick. The 3.5 jack works without issue with my regular Xbone headset.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    When it works, it's very good. It worked fine for 18 months and now has upwards drift in the right stick and the left stick skips when used for navigation in Xbox menus. I've tried various techniques for adjustment and cleaning of the controller and none have worked. I am the only user and I tend to play some every day. I'm an adult and I don't throw the controller around, my hands are clean and I keep food and drink away from it. It has never been dropped, thrown, hurled or chucked across the room. I know a bit about electronic and electrical components and there is ZERO reason for something like this to wear out in this period of time. Microsoft could spend like maybe 50 cents to a dollar more on the resistive components on the sticks to ensure they would remain free of dust and have a very long life.  But they don't because they know we will always need a controller. They know we won't throw out the Xbox and all our games because they chose to make a controller that won't last. They see us as dupes and as another income stream. As if the income from Xbox Live isn't enough. This is one small reason why people are beginning to realize that big companies are not something to celebrate or hold in esteem, but rather are manipulators and thieves who have no other goal than to find new ways of getting into our wallets. We can fight this, but we have to stop putting businesses and their leaders on pedestals and instead treat them with skepticism and disdain until they begin to behave in a more ethical manner.  Oh and we should regulate the crud out of them until they figure this out.\n  \n",

The issue with official XBOX One controllers is they cut costs by buying really bad switches for the analog sticks. They will start drifting up or to the side even when your finger is not touching them at all. I looked it up on google and its a major problem. Some fixes work, but only temporary. You should not need to open your controller to fixes issues every month.I seriously bought cheaper wired controllers (2 of them) and have not had any issues. they were <$30 each and USB extending cables from Amazon (<$9) still cheaper than some of these >$70 controllers\n  \n",

The buttons all feel tactile and presses really fine to a high accuracy. What ever Microsoft did to manufacture and also the software to communicate so well from the controller to the PC is like 0 lag feedback. I can play FPS games real well with this if i don't want to use my mouse and keyboard. Plus factor to this is that there are also many skins out there to customize the cosmetics of your controller and you can switch between AA batteries or having the Play and Charge Kit.Highlights:- Connects seamlessly when using adapter- Switch between AA batteries or Play & Charge Kit- Huge market to customize your controller with accessories and decals- It's Wireless\n  \n",

You need to install third party software for Windows to recognize it, its very temperamental, and a chunk of the features don't work properly because you're using said third party software. Getting the PS4 controller connected wirelessly is an ordeal too - again, since you're using third party software the controller never wants to connect. Steam has built in PS4 controller support, but getting that to function wirelessly is an even bigger ordeal than normal. So you're generally stuck using a wire.I decided to order the Xbox one controller because my buddies were raving about it. The difference between the two controllers is like night and day.First thing is, the Xbox controller is more ergonomic. It takes a little while to get use to the button placement, but it ends up feeling better and more natural. The shape of the controller fits your hand better, and the triggers feel much better. I do miss having the touch pad sometimes, but most of the time I'm just happy I'm not hitting it by mistake. The controller feels much higher quality, and it looks nice too.But the biggest improvement was the ease of setup and reliability. All you have to do is plug it in. That's it. No third party software, no finagling with steam, nothing. It just werks\u2122. Even the little Xbox button works - it pulls up a context sensitive menu. Heck, I can even use the controller outside games with no issue.Setting it up over bluetooth was a breeze too - i paired it one time and that was it. It turns out on it's own after a period of inactivity, and turning it back on just means pushing the Xbox button. With the PS4 controller getting it to reconnect each time watching an ordeal because of the software.One thing that excited me was the ability to plug a wired headset into the jack on the controller and still use the controller wirelessly. That meant I could use a wired headset from across the room just for discord or skype, while still having the sound for the game coming from my high end speakers. But there was a snag - you can't do that over Bluetooth. You can only do it plugged in over usb, or if using the Xbox one wireless adapter, which uses a proprietary format. Thankfully, that adapter was less than 20$ so I ordered one.But there is another snag - you either need to be using a headset with the special Xbox one headset adapter built in, or buy the adapter separately. Now this was a bummer - the adapter itself costs around 60$! So I tried plugging in a regular 3.5 headset to see if it would work anyway, but unfortunately it did not.I bought a Microsoft brand Xbox one headset today, and it works great. The quality isn't amazing, but that's the headsets fault and not the controller. I'm just using the headset for discord anyway - the quality doesn't have to be amazing because it's just for chat. It only covers one ear and is lightweight, so I'm perfectly able to hear the sound from the game itself coming from my nice speakers.Overall, this is a fantastic controller. Probably one of the best I've ever had. I highly recommend getting one, but just be aware that getting the headphone jack to function on a PC is more work than it appears and costs money.\n  \n",

( I find it odd that if I want to use the elite version of this controller, I have to buy the wireless dongle...)This controller also adds the option to turn it off by holding the center button, which the Xbox 360 controllers did not have.I also like the white color that I chose, the textured plastic surface is very comfortable, and the grip texture on the thumbsticks is out of this world.I've got about a dozen hours on it so far and everything has felt great, I was on the fence between getting this in the elite version...  obviously, that controller has more capabilities but the extra $140 I would have had to spend just didn't seem worth it...  Though truthfully, I might get myself an Xbox Elite controller for my birthday anyway.In the meantime, I am extremely pleased with this controller and recommended highly.\n  \n",

I thought it could be fixed with a simple cleaning -- upon opening the controller the insides were full of the same dirt/gunk from before, it was a genuinely suprising amount for the inside of a controller. After  brushing the stick free of any dirt with a Q-tip, closing the controller up, and testing again, the same problem persisted with the stick drift.

And it certainly feels like an upgrade! The sticks, face-buttons, triggers, and triggers all feel marginally improved (snappier and more responsive, but that might just be due to how old my other controller was), but the BIG improvement is in the d-pad. It's so much easier to interface with quickly without accidentally toggling the wrong direction (Dark Souls, I'm looking at you!), and the area it occupies doesn't feel so raised. All that with Bluetooth compatibility and excellent ergonomics make for a great controller.Some things worth noting:If the controller fully loses power (for instance, if the battery is removed), its memory of Bluetooth connections will be cleared, requiring that you re-pair your controller to your PC. To the best of my knowledge, you can't turn the controller off manually when using it with a PC, but the controller will turn itself off to save battery after a period of inactivity.If you use JoyToKey to map your controller inputs to keyboard inputs (to play games like Fallout 3 or Oblivion on PC with a controller, as I do), there may be extra steps you need to take to restore compatibility. JoyToKey is receiving the inputs from the wireless controller, but for some reason, the inputs don't reach the game. However, if I plug in the wired 360 controller, it'll work again. I'm not sure why this happens, and I haven't found a way around it yet.\n  \n",

The standard controllers should be recalled by Microsoft for faulty parts.I bought this as a replacement for a controller that developed the dreaded \"drift\". After I had a working controller back, I purchased a repair kit for the other controller. As soon as I opened the controller, I started to understand the issue. A small green colored piece of plastic fell out - which immediately was recognized as part of one of the analog sticks.The reason for the drift is that the control used breaks due to a parts flaw. The parts flaw is that the analog stick not built to handle downward pressure on the small switch. When it breaks off the stick the controller develops drift. Of course the downward pressure is what you need to make your character run in some games, so this will inevitably break quickly and you'll have a drifty controller.If you are handy with a soldering iron and desoldering pump, you can easily replace the analog stick in 10 to 15-minutes and save yourself quite a bit of money, especially if you buy several of them at a time.I'm not impressed with the build of Microsoft's controller and considering the price, beefing up the analog stick shouldn't even be a thought. The piece that breaks, the analog stick, is exceptionally flimsy and there appears to be no change being made to fix this well known and well document issue caused by under-engineered parts.

The only down side but that I'm ok with was that I couldn't connect via Bluetooth because apparently I need to have Windows 10 anniversary edition to do that so in case you want to use this on other Windows 10 version you need a charging cable. But like I said it is still worth it. If you are planning on buy a ps4 controller for PC please don't do it, I'm not against Sony or anything but I did research ps4 controller first as I actually like ps4 controller but I found a lot forums with people having issues connecting the controller to a PC .

It gives the illusion of the controller being lighter, but also wasn't a super pleasant change and made the controller feel cheaper and lower-quality.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Hi everyone,I have been a PlayStation fan boy my entire life, but a lot of my friends swapped to Xbox and I decided to purchase an Xbox one. The first game I played was The Witcher, so I clocked a little over 40 hours.Next, I started playing Apex legends and clocked between 15-20 hours. After that I played around 10 hours of COD before my controller decided to break (right analog stick went haywire). Here is my review of the product:Handling:I really enjoy the Xbox controller. It is sleek and has a nice feel to it (But I still enjoy the PS controller over the Xbox controller). The button layout is top notch, but the issue lies within the left and right stick (for me anyways). After playing Apex legends, I started noticing my character would slowly look down and to the right. At first it wasn\u2019t noticeable, but then it became apparent what was going on.Durability:I\u2019m not rough on my controllers. If I drop it, it usually lands on my bed or my lap. But I have noticed after three controllers within a two year span, the right stick seems to break a lot.Price:I\u2019m not the biggest fan of dropping $60.00 on a controller that tears up within a few months of gameplay. Whereas my PS4 controller has lasted a few years. And I contemplated purchasing the Xbox Elite controller, but both of my friends Elite controllers broke within a year.Overall, this is not a product I can recommend to anyone. I\u2019ve heard the old Xbox 360 controllers were amazing, but I feel like Microsoft cheapened out on this product. I am giving this a two star review, because it showed me how amazing my PlayStation really is.Sincerely,A PlayStation Fan Boy\n  \n",

Some would argue that the R/L triggers on the bottom take a lot of push to register input, but I personally thought it felt fine. Not as fast as some other controllers, like the Switch Pro or something similar, but responsive.Additional Features? 7/10There aren't a lot of bells and whistles here, what you're seeing is what you get. Once I got it setup on my PC the connection times were fast and simple. Hands down the best PC controller experience I've had once I got around a small Windows 10 hiccup. One feature I do really enjoy is the aux output in the bottom of the controller, I have not personally used it yet but being able to plug-in headphones into a controller is very convenient. And, while this may be a controversial choice to some, the controller's AA battery power is something I really like. I don't have to worry about charging the controller every day or two like I would if I was using my Switch controllers, very nice!All in all, I'm happy with this controller. I will be buying a couple \"mods\" for it improving on the triggers and thumb-sticks, but otherwise I would recognize the controller for use with PC gaming.\n  \n",

The Bluetooth version is nice because it makes your USB ports available for other things.To set this up you have to 1) push the big X button on the top side to power up the controller and then 2) push the (hard to see) black button on the front edge of the controller to make it \"Bluetooth discoverable\". You can then add the controller from the Windows 10 Bluetooth setup. No special software or drivers is required.My only complaint is that I feel that the older version of this controller had more resistance in the knobs.

I would say it was bad luck but this is the second controller this has happened to. The design is great but the build quality seems to be lacking.I only use it for Rocket League on my PC and there are certain moments when my grip intensifies slightly.

I\u2019ve been playing games all my life and never had this happen. Whatever the material is that houses the joystick and the clicking isn\u2019t very stirdy.The first controller this happened on was one of the elite models and is still playable, but the y axis has slowly becoming more over sensitive and i find myself doing involuntary backflips and summersaults.This model has loose pieces that occasionally get lodged in the triggers and the joystick is unable to click when angled between 1 and 6 o\u2019clock, so i wouldn\u2019t consider it usable now.\n  \n",

I have broken three Xbox one controllers to date and hate to have to buy yet another one but the only competition (non MS product) are wired controllers and given that I have kids and such that's not a viable option. So I'm going to have to shell out yet another 50 bucks to replace a product that keeps failing. Sounds to me like they designed them weaker so people would have to replace them. So far I'm averaging about 6-8 months on a controller before something intregal fails and I have to chuck it. And yes we did try to fix the first one that went bad and even bought a rebuild kit but it went from bad to worse and the design appears to make it so it will purposefully break if you try to get into it.

It is very easy to sync with the console, I went by the sync instructions and done.Turn on your console and hold the black button for 10 seconds and immediately turn on your controller and hold the black button for 3 seconds, they should find each other to connect. The black button on the controller is to the right of the black bumper, on the console the black button is located on the black strip under the on button. $42 is a bit steep for a simple controller, but it is worth it. I accumulate on my credit card and use that to pay.\n  \n",

Went through most YouTube videos on how to troubleshoot headsets and Microsoft forums and still it won\u2019t work. So we repeated the same process of purchasing a new headset and it still would not work. This morning I noticed a new controller update, updated all three controllers.

I recently began to play some PC games that play better with a controller than a keyboard. This replace my Logitech controller that I've used for a few years since the analog sticks on that aren't as 'precise' as this one.Overall I've enjoyed the controller, however recently I've run into a few issues..1. My initial usage of this controller was through the wired connection and occasionally would disconnect for no apparent reason (at the time.)2. Following the issue, I decided to add the Xbox to PC controller adapter and it's worked well on my main PC as well as been convenient.3. After roughly two months of wireless use I've switched to a cable again (See why at the bottom), and now the female port on the controller is unusable. I plug in the cable and it connects, so I move slightly to get comfortable and the connects and disconnects at a wild rate so long as I move. I have ~several~ of these cables strewn about the home and they all produce the same result. And it's virtually impossible to play a game without moving the controller slightly.I can continue using it via wireless, but only on a computer that has the capabilities to do so. Right now I'm unable to use the wireless adapter on my laptop because the drivers are supposed to be included with Windows 10 but for some odd reason my laptop refuses to update beyond a certain version of 10 therefore disallowing the use of the adapter.\n  \n",

I've ordered at least 5 of them, and each one had their own  unique combination of defects.Test everything about the controller. These are defects I've faced:- Bumpers make a loud, stiff, mechanical click instead of the normal smooth and soft click.- Triggers make a clicking noise when pushed down instead of the normal smooth feeling and no sound.- Analog sticks require excessive force to push down on them.- Back lining that hold the controller together is misaligned and sticking out instead of lining up normally.- The buttons stick down when you press down on them in certain directions (oh man I hate this one).- The D-Pad make a mechanical noise like something is loose inside when you press down on it in certain directions.- The battery cover is loose and pushing down on it makes an annoying noise.- The battery cover won't come off without excessive force.Yes, I've experienced all of these with the 5 or so controllers I've bought. Not fun.I luckily managed to get a white one that only has the bumper and loose battery cover issues. It works well despite its flaws. I would say that those two issues are the most minor of them all.I haven't been able to get a non-defective black one, which I really wanted. I even tried directly online from the Microsoft Store, but that was more broken than the ones I got from here. If you can, go to a Microsoft store in person and try it out right after buying it so you know.if you can get one that's not defective, they're amazing! Works natively on Windows without trouble. Although it is a little inconvenient that you need a cord (not included) to update the firmware. Takes a little time to get use to, but they feel so great in your hands. I've dropped it twice without damage. Keep trying until you get one that's minimally defective!\n  \n",

Now, in the middle a game my character will look around as if I\u2019m holding down the right thumb stick, my character moves backwards when I try to go forwards, Vice versa, when I press the triggers or bumpers, they don\u2019t work in the game as they\u2019re supposed to and I get killed, and even though the home button isn\u2019t being pressed, as soon as my Xbox turns off, it turns back on again unless I take out the battery pack. The standard controller I got with the Xbox lasted at least a year without any issues but this one didn\u2019t even last 3 months! Even more frustrating is that I don\u2019t play as much nowadays as I did a few years ago during my CoD, Skyrim, and GTA days, that standard controller suffered serious use and thrown at walls and floors but still persisted, unlike this one!\n  \n",

I tested it with Halo: Reach, which wouldn't work with my old gamepad, and it's fine for vehicles but for shootouts aiming is much easier using the mouse. The headphone socket is interesting but after brief attempts at testing it seems it may only work with an actual Xbox.PS: A few days after starting to use it I noticed the right thumb stick was grinding when pushed upwards. I applied a small amount of spray lube, which reduced the noise but it is still noticeable in the feel. I checked and the lube is still there so the problem must be a mechanical one, most likely a manufacturing fault in molding or precision of component positioning. This would indicate issues with the frequency of checks on the production line and quality control, most likely due to inadequately monitored outsourcing, a common problem with major brands these days.\n  \n",

Luckily I'm covered under warranty so it should be a pretty simple replacement process right? Nope.No way to claim the warranty on the controller without first registering your Xbox One Console. Well if you're like me and bought it for the PC and don't own an Xbox what are you supposed do? After about 2 hours of chatting with support they finally figure out how to honor the warranty without me owning an xbox. Here's the kicker, I have to mail it back to them, pay for the shipping to send them back their defective product, and wait 2-4 weeks on a replacement.Not worth the trouble or effort.I'm going to purchase a new controller from a retail store, with a protection plan and recommend anyone else wanting to purchase this controller to do the same.\n  \n",

It's September 15th, same year, and the left analog stick is drifting to the right now.I bought this controller because my old Xbox One controller, which I've had pretty much since the original Xbox One console came out, was doing the exact same thing. It was my hope that I'd buy a controller that would not only replace the one I had for the Xbox One, but allow me to play games on my PC as well with its bluetooth feature (which is a nightmare to setup for some reason and takes incredibly specific steps to get right, apparently. Not just turn on a sync like you'd imagine.). This new controller lasted about 100 days, then sadly broke. I'm sure the warranty is up by now, and even if I was still able to send it back to Microsoft somehow, I'd be without a controller for who knows how long.Obviously, I'm extremely annoyed by this and will probably have to look elsewhere for a controller seeing how I won't be buying this one again. My wallet can't afford to lose 50 dollars every 3 months on a controller that should last me YEARS like the old ones did. They are making these much cheaper than they used to which really was evident by the weight and feel of the thing when I first got it in May.I should also note that I used my controller in a normal fashion and without applying harsh pressure to any buttons or controls in fear that it would break before I got a few years out of it...but then it broke anyway.Please, I know you're thinking how I did when I researched controllers for hours that week, \"This guy's review might be a rare case and my controller might not do that if I buy it,\" but trust me, based on the cheap plastic and bad engineering, it eventually will. And probably SOONER than you'd hope.\n  \n",

When this happens, this causes a huge lag spike in the game I am playing. The frame rate will drop to the point of almost freezing and I will loose control of the game I am playing. This is a huge problem if I am playing a multiplayer game or a driving game.  Initially, thought it was due to the batteries dying, because when I replaced them, the issue went away for a while. However, I noticed that the issue would come back after only a short time with new batteries. I could just leave it plugged-in with a micro usb cord, but it is incredibly easy to accidentally unplug. Some other times I have to completely start over and re pair the controller to the Bluetooth as if it were a new because the controller sometimes can't reconnect otherwise. Overall I am disappointed with my controller and would not be surprised if I received a defective product.

Xbox One is an inconsistent machine and has some stupid procedures - needing to upload games to hard drive but still need disc to play for example or everybody needs microsoft acct but I digress - this controller is very mediocre at best.\n  \n",

So only one controller is actually usable.I was able to pair these to my PC using bluetooth and the gaming experience is great (other than the one button that's broken).I'd say definitely buy these, but check that all buttons work and that they register all the times they're pressed.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The Xbox controller has one of the best button layouts as well as shape among gaming controllers. Nothing seems as comfortable or as responsive as these controllers. The downside however, is that the quality of the build has not improved much and in fact I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019ve gone down in quality.The plastic has a texture to promote a better grip which has minimal effect. There is no built in battery which you can take it or leave it depending on your preference. You can\u2019t enable steam control for the home button. The vibration functions suck compared to DualShock 4 and even the switch joy cons. You absolutely need the PC dongle if you plan to use it on pc because Bluetooth has connectivity issues. And very fragile, if you are a rager just get a third party controllerThe pros do outweigh the cons... very very low latency. Comfort is at its best. Decent battery life if you shut off vibration which you get used too really quick. Best joysticks and buttons/triggers of any controller I\u2019ve used. Actually works great for mobile games with controller support if your into that.All in all, it\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s pretty darn close.\n  \n",

Otherwise, it's a step up from my older version of this controller.  The grip is nice and the hip buttons feel better.  Bluetooth connect is instant and only disconnects from RDR2 once in a while for some reason...all other games have been fine.  This was for my wife who plays Borderlands alot....didn't even notice the issue lol.\n  \n",
