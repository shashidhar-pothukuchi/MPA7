            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Like iphone 11 Pro, Macbook Pro, Airpad Pro; the \"Pro\" denotes a higher end product.Compared to the Airpods (version 2) highest end model (with wireless charging case*); the Airpods Pro is $50 more MSRP.Compared to the non wireless case version it's $90 more*Airpods Pro does have wireless charging case by default. Only one version.Let's go through the differences1. Physical Appearance:Shorter Stem, but larger bud or headThere's a large black airflow grillA mic inside and outside the AirpodsCase is same thickness, a lot wider, but shorter. Still uses lighting cable to charge, but it does come with a lighting to USB-C cable2. In-ear, instead of on-earIf your ear has a small cavum and the original airpods fit perfectly, then the Airpads Pro may be a tight fit/more uncomfortable, but seeing the in-ear design, the ear piece will go into the ear canal and the rest will float in place.Those with normal or larger cavum it'll fit well.Some may not like the ear piece going into their ear canalThese ear phones are more for a closed environment than an open oneSeeing that it's an in-ear design, you may feel this hollow air effect going on unless you turn on transparency mode (more on this later) or play music with active noise cancelling onSeeing that it's in-ear, it has a tighter grip, better for joggers, those who shake their head around a lot for some reason, or if you run up stairs often. If you have an intense workout regimen and/or do extreme sports and not mindful it still can fall outThere's a Ear Tip Fit Test on app. There's several ear tips in box. When you turn on this feature in app it'll calibrate and suggest what ear tips are best listening experience for youIf you lose the tips or get them dirty overtime, you can go to the Apple store and get replacement pair for around $4 or get cheaper 3rd party ones when they come out3. Squeeze instead of tapInstead of tapping on the earbuds, you are pinching or squeezing the stem.1x to play, pause, and answer calls2x to skip forward tracks3x to skip back tracksPress and hold to switch between active noise cancel and transparency modeStill able to say \"Hey Siri\" to do voice commands/adjust volume anytimeNo physical volume controls on buds4. Battery lifeBattery life varies depending on how far away you are from the device and volume you set. Battery depreciation over time. These are just rough estimatesPro in general has 4.5 listening time with active noise cancelling or transparency on. Airpods version 2 has 5 hours. Note Airpod version 2 does not have active noise cancelling or transparency mode.  You can get 5 hours with noise cancelling and transparency off, but most likely you're not going to unless you're really desperate for batteryPro has 3.5 talk time. Airpods have 3 hoursCase both old 24 hours battery lifePro: 5 mins in case = 1 hour talk or listen time. Airpods 15min in case = 3 hours listen, 2 hours talk5.  Water/sweat resistantNow you can go to the gym and do cardio with them on.As mentioned before, tighter grip seeing that it's in-earMay survive light rain. Do not recommended going in the shower or dunk in the pool with it though 6. Active noise cancellation, Transparency modeAirpods pro has 3 modes: Active noise cancellation, off and Transparency modeActive nose cancellation tries to block out outside noise while listening to music. I'd say it drowns out may 70%. If you focus to outside or aren't focused to music; you still may be able to pick out what's going on, but in general it does it's job.Off is just like the standard in-ear headphones, but with the hollow air sound when no music is playingTransparency mode. The black airflow grills let in outside sound so you're able to hear both outside sound and music same time. Think of it as open ear headsets.Unlike some in-ear headsets the black airflow grills prevent you from hearing yourself in your head when you talk7. Sound QualityBetter than the previous version seeing the active noise cancelling and in-ear with more focused sound direcly into your ear canal. It's not $250 audiophile quality sound.  Better quality sound in lows and mids compared to non-pro version. If you ever tried the Power Beats Pro, it sound very similar to thoseYou can hear callers better in a noisy environment and less likely raise your voice--Conclusion:Other than that, all other features are the same. Meant to be used on Apple devices. Very good ease of use for Apple users, and is in-style these days (shows social status). Sound quality is better that the non-PRO version, and you do get noise cancellation. There are other headphones that do it better sound in this price range, but may not be as convenient with pairing to Apple devices.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \u00a0Edit after 1 month:This  is popular in North America, and wearing it has become a fashion. I think it is the best electronic product after iPhone and Echo in the past 10 years.iPhone 4 Steve Jobs 2010Echo Jeff Bezos 2014Airpods Pro Tim Cook 20191. It is suitable for sports enthusiasts. Airpods Pro has a new anti-sweat function, so you don't have to worry about sweat damaging the headphones during exercise. Noise reduction function can isolate external sounds, so you can enjoy music at the same time2. Battery life. I tested the battery box for about 16 hours, and the headset has less than 5 hours. The noise reduction function may consume more power.3. It's not suitable for sleeping. When you wake up, you may find headphones everywhere. In addition, when the power is off, the beep is very annoying. It is recommended that friends who want to sleep use sleep earplugs.4, I found that the low-frequency sound quality will be more impactful and fuller than Airpods 2, but the overall sound quality is not much different from Airpods2Old review:I give this product 4 stars. I got this product before Black Friday and have been using it for 10 days. Here is my experience using headphonesAppearance: 3 stars1.The surface feel is the same as the previous two generations, and it is easy to scratch. It is recommended to buy a third-party protective case or a charging case with a protective case.2.Portability personally feels better than the previous two generations, because the appearance is flatter and the earstems are shorter3. There are three sizes of earbuds. The default is medium size. The little ears are still a bit painful after wearing them for a long time. Changing the trumpet is much better. The silicone sleeve is not easy to remove and replace. In addition, the silicone of the earphones is a bit smelly.4. Uneven gaps are found in the charging case. I don't think there should be any problems with the workmanship of the product at this price, so the appearance is only 3 stars.Comfort: 4 stars1. In-ear AirPods Pro is not as comfortable as non-in-ear AirPods.2. At present, it has been about 40 hours with earphones. It is said that there are stomata to regulate air pressure, so there will be no pressure in the ear for a long time. Ear pressure balance is better than Bose3. AirPods Pro will have better air tightness to the ears. Sony WH1000XM3 will have some air leakage, but Sony WH1000XM3 is a headphone. Among in-ear active noise cancelling headphones, AirPods Pro may be the smallest and integrated The highest degree and the most complete function4, running without worrying about falling, squat without worrying about pressing the neck. Its presence is much stronger than AirPods. You ca n\u2019t expect to wear it for a long time like AirPods before. You will forget its existence. In fact, it will always support your ears to remind you of its existence. One advantage is that compared to AirPods, AirPods Pro is stronger and harder to drop. For sports-loving users, AirPods Pro will be more suitable for you.5 stars1. Active noise reduction is the biggest difference between Pro and AirPods 2. AirPods Pro has three noise reduction modes, namely noise reduction on, off, and transparent mode. The official said that Apple \u2019s innovation in transparent mode, but I see other brands (Samsung, Sony) The headset also has a similar function.2, AirPods Pro's noise reduction is not as good as Sony WH1000XM3 on-ear noise reduction headphones, but it is the best among real wireless headphones. As for how to achieve such an obvious noise reduction effect in such a small volume, I don't understand. The intuitive feeling is that the noise reduction effect is obvious.3, I can feel quite quiet on the road, so it is strongly recommended to use noise reduction off or transparent mode on the road.Sound quality 4 starsThe AirPods Pro's sound quality has not been significantly improved compared to the previous generation of AirPodsSummary: This is an excellent headset. If you value the noise reduction function more, it is suitable for you. But if you are more concerned about the sound quality and have no need for noise reduction, I suggest you buy AirPods 2, because AirPods 2 is cheaper. In addition, the charging box and headphones must not be lost, the official charging box and headphones accessories are expensive\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700's, which I've been using daily for a couple of months so I'll compare to them.I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there's nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work.I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It's all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click \"connect\" in the bluetooth menu.Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn't seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don't use so I didn't test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no \"connected to xxx\" like the Bose does -- nothing else.For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won't be disappointed.Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It's hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they're fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I'm not sure why they weren't 100% if left in there overnight.There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can't control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it's okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface.There's no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it's been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There's a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it's hard to tell which mode you're in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice.Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don't have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I'll talk about in a minute. But there is also an \"off\" mode available only (that I've found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I'm guessing similar to previous AirPods.For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it's just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive.For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don't hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while.Would definitely recommend.\n  \n",

Even in noise cancelling mode they pick up voices and then they end up sounding robotic. There's a white noise in the background too. It's like a little static, annoying as hell.Just now I started hearing a popping noise in the right bud. It kept happening even when the music was off.

Price is on the upper end but the quality is also on the upper side compared to other models.I have QC35 and the noise canceling is comparatively good but being in-ear, the listening experience is much better.The transparency mode is awesome. It is like you NEVER wore the headphones. You have to try to experience it. I use it all the time in car and it is true \u201cyour gasoline car sounds like an electric car\u201d.Fit is snug and with extra tips, most of the people can get accurate fit. Make sure to run sound seal test from Bluetooth setting of AirPods.Each earpiece is about 1.25 inch, little shorter than earlier versions but they still stuck out of your ear and look little weird.Out of box, it comes with Airpods with wireless charging case, extra tips and USB-C to lightning cable. Note that it does not come with charging brick which is a bummer. But you can charge it with any other lightning connectors.Overall these are pretty decent noice cancelling headphones. Price is on the upper end, but I think quality is also on the upper side and I do think these are worth it. Would definitely recommend.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    If you\u2019re thinking about these and currently own the original style of AirPods, please check out my review below!Are these a replacement to the original AirPods? Not necessarily. I own these and two original style AirPods. I am an Apple fan girl and own one of everything they\u2019ve got. But even then, I\u2019m on the fence about the Pro\u2019s. First off...Comfort and FitIf you\u2019ve ever tried out the PowerBeats by Dre, they fit just like them minus that extra ear anchor. It takes some getting used to but thanks to transparency mode, I don\u2019t think I could really wear another pair of IEMs / earbuds again. They 100% will not make you feel like your ears are clogged and not can you hear your own voice as one would with earbuds.However, I\u2019m hung up on the fit. I was one of the lucky few who the original AirPods fit just right. However, these just hurt after 20-30 minutes. I tried all the different sizes  of ear tips but none work. Ultimately, I wish Apple included foam versions of their ear tips. So be warned that these might hurt! Assuming they don\u2019t hurt, then...Sound QualityThe sound quality is great. It\u2019s nice and clear, balanced and at times not packing the bass I was possibly expecting. The HomePod has a very, very strong bass signature and I thought these would be similar. But, nope! When third party foam air tips come out, I\u2019m pretty sure that will help the bass out. (Bass needs a good seal when it comes to earbuds.)Are these better than the original AirPods? Maybe. Because of that seal from the ear tips, the sound quality is drastically improved. With third party ear tips, the original AirPods sound pretty similar to these. I do appreciate the dynamic EQ which helps the sound a lot. But, be warned that they will sound like garbage if you have an EQ set in Apple Music on your iPhone. Make sure to set it to off or Late Night, otherwise they\u2019ll sound a lot worse! Ultimately, you won\u2019t be disappointed and they sound great, better than the originals because of that sound seal, but not mind blowing!Battery LifeThey\u2019re pretty in par with the original AirPods with battery life even with Transparency and noise cancellation on. You can go all day with these just like the originals!SpeedThis is what I love about them the most! This is the reason why I prefer these over the original AirPods. The Pro\u2019s are so much snappier with Handoff, switching from device to device, pausing and restarting, etc. They also more accurately get picked up by your iPhone and Apple Watch. I really wish they would upgrade the hardware in the original design just like these. (We\u2019ll see!) also, the Pro\u2019s more intelligently go on standby when out of your ear, resume faster when they go in your ear, etc. They just do everything faster! I also appreciate the fact that you pinch the stem instead of tapping them. Whoever thought of tapping didn\u2019t realize how uncomfortable that \u201cgesture\u201d would be in practical usage.OverallI love them but they\u2019re like the cousins of the original AirPods. They\u2019re not a replacement but a different flavor. These are great for working out and stay in my ears during running. The new features and speed in combination with the improved sound delivery makes them an easy upgrade \u2014 so long as you find them comfortable, that is!\n  \n",

If I use it for less than two hours or so there won't be any problems as it preforms very well. The main problem is that if I wear them for over 2+ hours they start to hurt both my ear which is weird because the older models \"wired/wireless\" I have no problem with while they are in my ear all day long. \"I have tried changing the rubber from large to small still doesn't help.\" It seems like the new design are a little thicker than the older generations.

The old Airpods fit my ear well, these new ones fit even better. My ears do not get hurt after hours of wearing. And these do not even come close to falling out when I run.- Noise cancellation and transparency mode: both work amazingly.- Waterproof. However these are only splash proof. Meaning rain/spills/sweat are ok, but no swimming yet.- Sound quality: very decent. But probably not too insane to satisfy audiophiles.- Build quality: superior, as expected from Apple. Especially when consider small details like the silicon eartips. They snap extremely well into the Airpods and are very, very hard to remove.- Sync: very well with iPhone and Mac, as expected from Apple. Have not tested with Android, Windows.- Size: very conveniently small. You can easily wear them lying down in bed. Traveling case is also pretty small (just a tad bigger than old Airpods' case)- Design: this is very subjective. But I think the Airpods are the best looking earbuds in the market right now. Big reason why I choose them over other headphones.Cons:- Battery life: they're ok, I wish they last longer. Quote from Apple, battery lasts up to 4 hours 30 minutes of music time. In reality it lasts a bit more than 4 hours. But sometimes I wear them continuously way longer than that. Very sad.\n  \n",

And AirPods pro is definitely one of my favorite.Pros:\u2022 It is very easy to get into and stay in my ear. It won\u2019t fall out. Also it is much more comfortable than Powerbeats pro.\u2022 The ANC works surprisingly well. It is very similar to my beats studio 3. It is amazing how Apple fits everything Into such a small body.\u2022 The bass is better than AirPods 1 and 2. It feels more bouncy.Cons:\u2022 Since AirPods pro doesn\u2019t support tap control any more. 2 fingers are required to pause or to control the AirPods, which IMO is not as good as tap control.Overall, it is good although a little pricy.Update:After using it for couple months, I have to say I was wrong about not falling off. Sometimes they do fall off. And AirPods 1 and 2 stay better in my ear.\n  \n",

I wore the originals almost constantly and honestly can only remember once that they came out of my ear.  I just never worried about them.  This is NOT the case with the new Pro.  They fall out of my ear everyday and many time more than once a day.  I mean you bend over to pick something up and they are likely to fall out.  I have tried all three ear bud sizes that come with the Pro, and while the new design looks like it would be better beware, they fall out!  Sick with the original AirPods!The sound of the Pro is great!  The new noise cancelation is excellent.  The battery life seems to be a bit better than the original and I really like the ability to pause the playback by touching the Pro.  (If only they stayed in my ear! )\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I was very excited to try the new Airpods Pro, but unfortunately they are not for me. The main issue was the active noise cancellation (ANC). These were the first pair of ANC headphones I've owned, and it seems that I am in the minority of people who experience a strong negative reaction to ANC. Within moments of turning it on, I experienced head pressure, mild headache, and mild nausea. If you have never used ANC headphones before, be aware that the experience may not be as comfortable or magical as other say. Here is a breakdown of my thoughts on these Airpods:The Good:Fit: The fit was very comfortable and secure. I haven't tried the regular Airpods, but these fit great and seem very secure.Size: Both the Airpods and the charging case are compact and very portable. I have a pair of Bose Soundsport Free headphones and the charging case is at least 3 times larger than these.The mediocre:Sound: Based on reviews, I expected these to sound better. In fact, I thought they sounded worse with ANC on than off. Overall, I think my 2-year-old Bose Soundsports sound better, which is maybe not surprising but a bit disappointing given the price for these.The bad:ANC: Your mileage may vary, but I found using ANC a profoundly uncomfortable experience. I also felt like it did not cancel much more noise than having it off. Both of these factors negate one of the main selling points for these Airpods.Color: The Airpods and the case are dirt magnets. Even using them for less than a day, they were already picking up lots of dirt. I can't see keeping these clean in the long run.Overall: If ANC worked better for me, I could overlook the other shortcomings of these earbuds. As it is, I'll be sticking with my Bose Soundsports and sending these back.\n  \n",

With the new design, I was hoping the seal would produce the same effect, ensuring high quality sound under all conditions. While they are comfortable and have excellent noise cancellation, I would almost go as far to say the sound quality is the same or worse than the original model. Maybe mine were defective; but, all of my music sounded crisp on the high end and peripherals, while feeling completely empty in the center. It is almost like Apple included an artificial surround enhancer or DSP, by default. Regardless, with the $250 price tag, I was told to expect better. Yes, there are new features and a new design; they are pretty and interface seamlessly with your iPhone. However, if sound quality is your primary concern, I would look elsewhere, or stick with what you have.\n  \n",

The all-new, lightweight, in-ear design boasts a customizable fit while providing complete sonic performance. Use Active Noise Cancellation to keep you focused on enjoying your content, or switch to Transparency Mode to stay aware of what's going on in the environment around you.To ensure a rewarding listening experience, the AirPods Pro utilize Adaptive EQ to automatically sculpt the tonal output to suit your unique ear shape. Their custom high-excursion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers deliver clear, detailed sound with bass down to 20 Hz, all while keeping distortion low and upholding extended battery life. The flexible silicone eartips come in three sizes and advanced algorithms allow the AirPods Pro to analyze the fit and let you know if the current eartip size is giving the ideal seal.Following a single-tap setup, these AirPods automatically turn on and maintain their connection to your iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac computer; forget having to manually engage or disengage power. Enjoy music, answer calls, or communicate with Siri on your mobile device without having to pull out your iPhone.These AirPods automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say \"Hey Siri\" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge\u2014or 4.5 hours of listening time in Active Noise Cancellation mode, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a wireless charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time or over 18 hours of talk time. Just 5 minutes in the case gives you approximately one hour of listening time. Charge the case via a Lightning connector or take advantage of its compatibility with Qi mats (available separately) for true wireless charging.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Compared to the original AirPods, the form factor of the case and the earbuds just look awkward, but the functionality is great.This is the kind of the ugly older brother to the originals that is more powerful.TRANSPARENT MODETo me,the best feature is the \u201ctransparent mode\u201d sound. This uses the microphones from the noise cancelling feature to actually pass ambient sound through to your ears while you listen to music or the phone.  It seems like such a small feature, but ultimately, the ability to walk around with full environmental awareness AND music or your phone is pretty awesome. It makes the music presence more like high quality background sound All the time.NOISE CANCELLATIONI put these in when I was on a plane alongside my Bose Noise Canceling headphones. The performance was comparable or possibly even slightly better because these seal your ear. Given the match in performance, I\u2019d rather wear these because it\u2019s easier to sleep.SOFT BUD TIPSThe soft bud tips aren\u2019t magic, they just work the way all other bud manufacturers have been doing for years. \u201cOooh, but Apple made them white and...\u201c nope, just soft tips. Move along.CHARGINGCompared to the originals, these function the same. If you have OCD and use your earbuds all day long, you may find they need to go into the case sooner by half an hour or something ... but I\u2019ve seen no real difference in regular \u201cin/out/in/out\u201d daily use.CASEWith a millimeter difference here or there, it\u2019s the same size as the original case, rotated 90 degrees.IPHONE INTEGRATIONSame special proprietary features as the originals, but the icon looks like a pair of confused ducks.OVERALLI wear them every day, leave them in when I\u2019m not using them and consider them a key part of my work life for phone calls and music. Do they constitute a full upgrade to the originals? Not totally, but somewhat.The transparent sound is the main \u201cwow\u201d feature, and the noise cancellation is solid. If the loose feel of the originals bothered you, the new tips solve that. If you don\u2019t care about the cost of buying new ones so soon after getting the originals, these are a worthwhile improvement on the originals and you\u2019ll be happy.If I lost mine, I\u2019d pay for another pair.\n  \n",

The old Airpods hurt my ears after an hour or so of wear.- Sound quality: Better fidelity all around, especially in noise canceling mode. No comparison to the old Airpods.- Noise canceling: Crazy good - if it's on, don't expect to hear any outside noise at all. Not available with the old Airpods.- Transparency mode: Perfect blend of being able to hear what's going on in the larger environment while still listening to music/calls/audiobooks, etc. comfortably. Easy to switch between transparency and noise canceling. Not available with the old Airpods.- Battery life: Delivers long life as promised, and charges quickly.

Now you may think im weird for using these with my google pixel 3, but I have tried samsung gear iconx and jaybirds x3 in the past, and neither were a suitable option for me, despite their good passive noise cancellation. I love the active noise cancellation on these airpods, and it makes tasks such as leave blowing and other loud low tone things much more tolerable.!!!!!ANDROID COMPATABILITY!!!!!!I am amazed at how quick these were to pair with my android phone. This may be a new thing apple has allowed, I dont know, because these are my first pair of airpods. Connection is almost instant, and the airpods pro are always connected by the time I get them in my ears. Also, noise cancellation works and so does ambient mode of course. I have an iphone as well, but it is old. I used this iphone for the sole purpose of doing apple's proprietary fitment test, to see if I should change my eartips. On android hey google works, and I was surprised at how strong the connection signal, sound quality, and ease of use are on these airpods pro. I would highly recommend these airpods, because despite being on android, they are a very seamless experience, and once you hear the surrounding worlt melt away with the nosie cancellation, the steep price should no doubt be justified!!!!!!!\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    For background, I am a recreational music producer and have typically used studio monitor setups ranging in price from $400 to over $1000. I have also owned a variety of Bose products including the QC15 noise cancelling headphones and multiple generations of SoundSport earbuds. I listen to at least 2 hrs of music a day. The listening experience on these earbuds vastly exceeds the Bose products I have owned and also rivals my professional grade KRK studio monitors. I will break down my review into a few categories:SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIOThe signal to noise ratio of these earbuds is truly exceptional. I have never heard any headphone or studio monitor with anywhere near as good of a signal to noise ratio. I am hearing details in music that didn't even come through clearly on my KRK studio monitors.NOISE CANCELLINGThe noise cancelling is very good. Better than my Bose QC15s (headphones!) which were the industry standard years ago (granted, I haven't tried recent leaders like the Surface or Bose QC35s because I don't own them). For earbuds, I am impressed at how well they can block out sound.FIT and SEALI have average size ears so I chose the standard \"medium\" ear tips. My right earphone stays planted, but my left earphone slowly slips out over time. I believe this is due to the shape of my ear. They're not the most comfortable earbuds I have used because they have to press against your ear to make a good seal. After about an hour of listening I'm ready to take them out of my ears for a bit.FREQUENCY RESPONSEThe AirPods Pro have a pretty good frequency response. Mids are very clear and highs are sharp but are not piercing which is not easy to do. Bass is surprisingly a little heavy.. And I have a 1500W subwoofer in my car and a 8\" KRK sub connected to my studio monitors. So I'm a bit surprised at how much bass Apple decided to put in these. It's not at the point that it's distracting but I would say it's a little more low end than would be present in monitor grade equipment. For reference I listen to Hip Hop and Electronic music that tends to place a lot in the low end.TRANSPARENCY MODEThe transparency mode uses the microphones to amplify ambient sounds if you want to be more connected with the world around you such as when in an office where you might be approached. It definitely works. It sounds a bit artificial and not quite like real life but it surely helps hear what is happening around you. I would say this is not the setting to use for the best listening experience. Noise cancelling mode really helps engulf you in the music and is my preferred listening mode.CONVENIENCE:Pairing to Apple devices is a breeze. I have a Mac, iPad, and iPhone and it is very quick to switch between them when I need. I have not tested connectivity on other devices, but it should work just fine as a normal bluetooth device for other equipment.OTHERFor some reason I thought these came with an app that would allow EQ modifications but they do not. Luckily the standard tuning is pretty balanced but like I said the low end is a bit inflated.Overall, these earbuds exceeded my expectation for the price point and are worth every penny. I am very happy with these!\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    As an owner of the 1st gen and 2nd gen AirPods I can honestly say these are worthy of the upgrade.  The ear tips are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be for extended wearing and also hold them in place.  With older AirPods design they would fit but when moving around and even just talking (moving your jaw) they would wriggle from their set position.  Also, I didn't care for the loud sound pressure transferred to your eardrum when tapping to issue commands either of the older generation units.  These new Pro model buds have a pressure sensor on each bud stem you press/pinch to activate features.  They make little single click/tick sound when pressed. One press for Play/Pause/Answer/Hangup, Two-presses for next track, Three-presses for previous track. So far the best feature is noise cancellation which is fantastic.  Calgon, take me a away. The peacefulness is bliss.  The only nag I have so far is with the shorter stem they can be a little fumbly putting them into and getting them out of the charging case.  I haven't had them long enough to test call-quality (both audio and microphone quality) but will update if anything comes up.  I did make sure the firmware updated to latest version as I've heard others speak of microphone call quality with original/shipping firmware version, so I am interested to see if this new version resolves it.  All in all I can highly recommend them and will come back and either bump rating to 5 stars or keep it at 4Update ~6 month (04/17/2020). Still at 4-stars. All in all a decent upgrade over Gen 2 AirPods and best wireless buds out there I think. Still some software/firmware bugs requiring to put back in case or reset and repairing them to get them working again. Also, microphone voice quality is horrible. On par with gen1 and gen2 AirPods and this is one of the major items I hope Apple targets for the next model(s). Mic noise cancellation is pretty good but voice quality is just lacking. Some would call fidelity of the microphones very compressed and tinny. If you can pick these up for 235+tax they are a decent deal. If they\u2019d get to 199+tax it would be much better.  I still highly recommend them.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    UPDATE: These are literally designed to have a short lifespan. There is no way to fully discharge the batteries from both the case and the pods as the pods do not work if the case is dead, although they work without the case if you had already started using them. This is to depreciate the lifespan on the product itself. With lithium ion batteries you need to fully discharge between charges for the best battery life. Seems like Apple has designed these in a manner where you actually can\u2019t do so. Pathetic.I really didn\u2019t have crazy expectations for these but they\u2019ve let me down in every way.-Doesn\u2019t even come with a power block to charge the device, because they make you buy it separately.-Sound quality doesn\u2019t match the price tag as it\u2019s very heavy on the bass and mid range but treble is almost non-existent.-Water exposure rating is extremely poor, which won\u2019t be covered by Apple care if you get these wet or too sweaty and they stop working.-Battery life should be better for the price tag as these do not last as long as advertised.-The case is poorly designed as it\u2019s extremely easy to accidentally push the cap backwards which will break it off.-These are designed to be inoperable if they need maintenance or are malfunctioning as the housing is glued together. If you open them up, you\u2019d never be able to put them back together again.-Since these cannot be repaired, it contributes to our global pollution problem as once you\u2019ve reached your max recharge amount and degraded the battery, there\u2019s nothing to do but throw them away and get new ones.Apple really needs to do better. This is just another example of how badly they\u2019ve let these products slip.-No way to locate the device if it gets lost.-No security functions to keep strangers from making it their own if they find it or steal it.-Have to get a case for the case because it scratches insanely easily.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Both the Apple Airpods Pro and the Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds had very good reviews so I decided to purchase both and see which one worked for me.Sound:I have been in audio engineering for 40 years but honestly sound is a very personal thing. Some people like heavy bass while I prefer a genuine full spectrum experience, as if I were sitting in front of a live orchestra. That said, I suspect the Sony earbuds will make the bass aficionado very happy. In my opinion they lacked a full range experience while the Apple was very refreshing making every instrument stand out, even the softest notes. Both had good quality as far as NO distortion even at max volume. Speaking of volume, the Sony could not achieve the same loudness as the Apple. (I should also point out that I was using an Apple iPad Pro as my source device, not that it \"would or should\" make a difference) The Apple also had better clarity most likely because the Sony bass drowns everything else out making it sound a bit muddy.Comfort:In my opinion the Apple wins this one hands down. The Sony is much heavier and seems to run a bit hot as my ears literally burn when I use them. I can't imagine trying to listen long term with the Sony while the Apple earbuds feel very comfortable for the long haul. They both have different size buds that can be interchanged very easily. The Sony has more options and even has two different materials that might appeal to someone who has skin allergy. The down side of the Apple might be that because they are so light it might be easier to loose them however if one the Apple buds fall out, the sound comes to a halt on both which is very nice. Another thing to point out for the athletic type is that the Apple is sweat resistant where the Sony is not.Function and Control:I hate to keep harping on the Sony but once again it mostly fails in this category. One thing the Sony has that I truly like is the ability to pass through external sounds by simply touching and holding the left bud. This also pauses what you are listening to while you attend to the interruption. Once you release your finger it resumes your music or whatever you are listening to. Unfortunately the Sony tap (touch) control for pausing, advancing and changing sound modes are hit or miss at best. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't making for a very frustrating experience. The Apple has a little microswitch on each bud that consistently works as advertised.  Either left or right bud of the Apple perform the same function while the left and right buds of the Sony have unique functions. The Apple has a seal test that you can run in the app settings to help you get a good fit.UPDATE: After loading the latest firmware the controls are much better for the Sony. No other improvements noted.Carrying Case:On both of these the case function as an integral part of the system. They both have internal batteries that charge the buds while the buds are in the case. The Apple case is a bit smaller and lighter making it the better choice for my pocket. The Apple can also be charged wirelessly or by USB cable where the Sony must use a cable only.  The Sony is more stylish and feels more expensive. I haven't yet tested battery run time but from what I've read, they are both similar.Summary:Overall the Apple is my pick and makes me very happy. I'm sure there are many more options one might consider concerning either of these brands but this is just my experience in a nutshell and I hope it is helpful.\n  \n",

Some of the cheaper buds sounded good, but in order to get good sound, you had to have the perfect seal.  In my case, the seal would be fine until I moved around, then the buds would work their way out of my ears just enough to render the bass response useless. One the ear headphones like the Bose and Sonys sound terrific with good NC, but my ears would get warm.  Cheaper headphones didn't have solid NC and most times felt like my head was in a vice after 30 minutes.Apple has created the perfect listening device.  NC is phenomenal and the sound, while not comparable to big cans is remarkable with solid bass.  The ear fit test is brilliant and works perfectly.  It determined I needed a different tip for my right ear.  And to top it off, these buds are so comfortable (like the regular AirPods), you don't even notice they're in your ears.Yes, they're expensive.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I bought these to help block out distracting office noise.  Unfortunately (and ironically), the noise cancelling algorithm on these actually make the distractions worse.  The AirPods Pro removes the white noise that had been masking conversations and abrupt sounds.  With them in, it's actually harder to concentrate.  I truly hope the magicians at Apple can improve the noise cancellation program via firmware update.  It is not in the same league as Bose and Sony at this point.  It is also not as customizable.As far as sound quality goes, I had been scared by other reviewers into thinking these were absolute garbage.  I'm happy to say that's not the case.  They are generally balanced and pleasant to listen to.  The bass is present but not over-accentuated.  The mids and highs are also present but not irritating.  It's close to being good.  There are better options out there, obviously.  My favorite pair of wireless ears is the Bose SoundSport Wireless, which is, by the way, cheaper and more appropriate for working out.  Apple's sound should have a bit more low frequency extension and more customizability.  By the way, having a good tight fit in crucial to achieving proper low-end response on any in-ear headphone.  So if the bass sounds weak to you, try a bigger tip and make sure to push it in snugly!As far as the mic, it's OK.  It sounds about like you'd expect.  Everything else works pretty flawlessly.  The charging case is easy and intuitive.  Putting them in your ears (one or both) is easy and intuitive.  Pairing them was a breeze.  They look pretty good too, if that's important to you.It's a 50/50 toss up now if I return them or not.  I already have better sound in the Bose SoundSport Wireless, and these are not adding the noise cancelling functionality I was hoping for.UPDATE: It may be placebo effect, but I think the most recent firmware update really has helped the noise cancelling feature on these perform better.  They are still not on par with Sony's technology, but it seems better.  You just have to add a little noise from the Coffetivity app or the White Noise app to further drown out the office noise.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have only had these for 1 day and I am debating whether or not to return them. I have had every generation of the airpods (e.g. Airpods 1 and Airpods 2). Why did I get these? Well, because I lost my previous Airpods and I was intrigued by the anti-sweat claims of this product. However, I am on the fence as to whether to return them because after about 30 minutes of a hard run, the silicon tips kept coming out. Every time I would try to push them back in it was awkward because I was running fast. What's more, each time I tried to readjust the tips and jam them into my canal (imagine me doing this running a 6:30 mile), I kept hitting the button on the stem and stopping/the music. For the last 10 minutes of my run I just threw the airpods into the treadmill cup. I am now trying smaller buds in hopes that they will work. I will say that the noise cancellation and the transparency mode is amazing. The speaker and sound is superb. But that won't mean much if my main use case (running with these on at high speeds and with lots of sweat) doesn't work. I will update this review in a week or so.UPDATE: I am definitely returning these. The first Apple product that I am extremely disappointed in. The left Airpod fell out multiple times during my run yesterday at high intensity. What is more, the Airpod has started emitting a high-pitched squeak/squeal sound. You can do a Google search on this and many users have complained of this. It appears to be related to the noise cancelling feature and there is definitely a design flaw. I'm disappointed and will be going back to the Airpods 2. I really wanted to these to work, but for serious runners, I would look elsewhere.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I've ben using these AirPods pro earbuds for 2 weeks now. These are the best of the 5 different pairs of high-end earbuds I own. However, to make them  work for my ears, I upgraded the ear tips to foam.  The included silicone tips kept falling our of my ears, and I tried all 3 sizes.  On Saturday the left ear fell out 3x on my 2 mile walk. So - I found an upgrade offered by an eBay seller that includes foam tips with a clip that replaces the apple silicone tips.The foam works like a charm. Not only do they fit great in my ears, they don't fall out , and fit easily in the original charging case.  The bass and highs are now both cleaner and crisper..  Apple should revisit using foam similar to the comply tips.I'm writing this review after my walk today because the AirPod pros are absolutely sensational with this foam tip upgrade.  I predict, that all the haters would change their minds, if they had a chance to try this for themselves.Other features I like: noise reduction works great, the touch sensitive switches on the earpieces also work perfectly. Charging is quick, and switching between an iPhone and MacBook pro is seamless.  The sheer convience of these AirPod pros is reason enough to use them any Apple products.Apple designers should be proud of this product. I love tech, and these earbuds are the best of the bunch.  Enjoy!\n  \n",

Unfortunately, she has smaller ears, so the largeness of the white plastic piece, not the interchangeable silicone pieces, feels uncomfortable after short term usage. Even for me, the largeness of the ear bud starts to feel uncomfortable after an hour or so. They at least stay in when exercising.The noise canceling helps but doesn\u2019t completely block out external noise. You can still hear the subway, people talking, etc. There is a high pitch squeal, like feedback, that occurs when lying your head down on the AirPods Pro. One forum said it\u2019s likely mic feedback from the noise canceling.I also noticed that with an iPhone 6, the AirPods Pro would cut out occasionally. Oddly, it was when I was walking and my hand would hit my phone in my pocket.I probably won\u2019t buy this shape of true wireless headphones when purchasing in the future, unless they are able to reduce the ear bud size or improve its comfort.I do appreciate the compact recharging case, addition of the silicone ear piece, reduced profile of the external control stems, and the control functions and stable communication with my iPad 7 and iPhone 11.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Oh my goodness. These are incredible.1) Background & Comparison:I have had the Bose QC35 headphones for a year, and just purchased the Bose SoundSport Free (after purchasing the AirPods Pro) and love them both, but these AirPods Pro buds are SO lightweight I actually forgot I had left one in my ear at work the other day (no music playing of course). I don\u2019t see a need for wearing my QC35s anymore because they\u2019re heavy and large. After I purchased the AirPods Pro, purchased a pair of Bluetooth Bose Soundsport Free to compare sound and bass. Sound quality is great on the SoundSport Free model but I have issues with the size (even smalls tips hurt my ears) and they are bulky. Sorry, Bose, I really wanted to love your product but the AirPods Pro win for me due to size, ease of use, and comfort.\u2014\u20142) Fit:My ears hurt with a lot of earbuds styles bc I have smaller ears, but the medium sized tips surprisingly fit great. There\u2019s functionality to test the ear tip fit while you have them in your ear - I assume it tests pressure and seal that the tips make in your ear canal. They also don\u2019t fall out and seem completely snug. I did work out in them, but haven\u2019t run or done any kind of strenuous activity with them, but would be interested to see if they stay in while running. So far, I would assume they do based on the secure fit.\u2014\u20143) Noise cancellation & transparency mode:I work in an open office and was completely shocked by the noise cancellation mode. It is AWESOME and really muffled out most (95%?) of the noise. I might wear these at work without playing music just so it\u2019s quiet and I can focus better. Transparency mode is excellent for doing things around the house or wearing on a trail where I need to be cognizant of surroundings, and still want to hear my music.\u2014\u20144) Audio quality:I feel like I don\u2019t need to turn these up as loud as I have had to with other brands. Ear tip fit is great and sound is crystal clear. I wish they had more bass, but I do find the bass quite sufficient. I generally seek out bass in my headphones because of personal preference, and I\u2019m happy with them. I do wish there was an equalizer to be able to adjust the settings for the use, but I\u2019ll leave that to my music apps to do. Sound quality is great and I hope it will save my ears a little bit from not having to turn them up like I have had to with my other earbuds previously.\u2014\u20145) Conclusion:These are amazing. Form and function are great, and most of all, they are lightweight and ease of use is excellent. Highly recommended.\n  \n",

I didn't love the originals, the battery life wasn't great.  They'd be cooked on a 2 hour conference call before the call was over.  90 mins in you have to pull one pre-emptively and place it in the case to catch a charge then swap.  I figured these would be the same, but they are considerably better.For comparing the original release w/o wireless charging case, if the second gens have a better battery life then this may not apply.  But with the Pro's I can easily stay on a 3+ hour call (sounds fun doesn't it?) w/o having to charge them.The noise-canceling is nowhere near as good as Bose over the ear, maybe not even as good as the Amazon Echo buds.  but it's adequate.  I haven't taken them on a plane yet but they easily cancel out basic background noises.Anyone that tells you they don't hear people sitting next to them or loud traffic is smoking crack.  None really cover-up that type of noise.I will buy these again when I lose one.  That is the biggest downside.  They are slippery but so are the originals.That's all I have to say.

These airpods do charge wirelessly in the case but you will eventually need to recharge the case up which is why they include a chaging cord but it is USB C to take note of that.  There is also no volume control on the earbuds. You need to go to your phone which can be inconvenient if jogging or working out with them. They also do not cancel low frequency sound from neighbor's audio equipment but then nothing so far has.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Not worth the money.  Very disappointed in the noise cancellation.  I\u2019ve worn these on a plane and they only cancel out about 60% of the engine noise.  I occasionally work in a large data center where there\u2019s a consistent equipment hum of about 84 decibels, and I estimate that these are only blocking out about 75% of the noise.  The noise cancellation software needs some serious updating.  The sound transparency mode is pretty good so that you can hear people talking and sounds around you.  There\u2019s just a slight filtering of the sound, so it\u2019s not completely transparent.  Good enough to leave the EarPods in and still hear what\u2019s going on around you.The BIG downside to these are that the EASILY fall out!!  I\u2019ve tried the different sized ear tips, and ran the Air Pods Pro sound/noise cancellation tests and I\u2019m using the correct size tips.  On a plane, I nodded off for a bit and woke up to a missing AirPod.  I had to wait until the plane landed and everyone got off to search for the AirPod.  It rolled a few rows back winding up under a seat with a bunch of garbage and dirt.  On a return trip, I put them in, and within 5 minutes, one fell out again.  Forget about moving around with them in, as they will definitely fall out.  If you bend over, they fall out.  You will find yourself constantly pushing them in to avoid losing them.  I had to buy a silicone strap to keep the two attached to each other so the don\u2019t venture off.  The use of the strap is ridiculous, and shouldn\u2019t be necessary, but I don\u2019t feel like buying a replacement AirPod and wasting more money.The battery charge lasts at least five hours, and charges quite quickly in the included charging case.Overall, save yourself about $200 and spend $50 on a decent pair of wired ear buds, which will have the same audio quality.  A very disappointing purchase!!\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Honestly, I was a little bit spectacle about purchasing this AirPods, because I know the original ones are just like the wired Apple earphones, where you can hear the sounds from outside and I did not want to spend 100$+ for earphones that can hear outside! Smh So I did my research diligently (for weeks). Finally decided to purchase the AirPods pros for my birthday especially because I love Apple and after my LG TONE Pro HBS-770 broke down within 10 months smh, never buying again.I am a huge audiophile and especially when it comes to picture and sound; I look for the best. I tested both LG and AirPod Pro and the Pros comes in first because it does block out any noise from the outside - I would say mostly 80%. I also hear that it adapts to the sound to actively block out any noise outside especially when I shop: I can\u2019t hear my footsteps, the people around, the car on the streets. It\u2019s amazing! Plus I can leave them in my ear and they are so comfortable, especially when I\u2019m on the treadmill they stick like glue! Plus it helps with the sweat resistant feature the AirPods provide! Sometimes I forget they are in my ear lol also the transparency mode works well so I don\u2019t have to remove my earphones (but seriously I\u2019m listening to music why are you talking to me) lolI also love switching between Noise cancellation and transparency modes. Golden. Even when the modes for Off, the sound is still particularly good.My recommendation is that if you are or not an audiophile and you want to purchase AirPods, go for the AirPod Pros. You won\u2019t be disappointed. 249$ it can be high, but it\u2019s money well spent. It\u2019s better to spend a little more or a lot more to get what you want versus spending 100$ less and you aren\u2019t satisfied.... life is too short!

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The noise cancellation isn't the greatest. Of course, our expectations for the noise cancellation won't be similar to Sony's  wh-1000xm3 be we should expect it to be pretty decent right? It's not. People have had concerns about the if listeners would hear a car or train coming up behind them but listeners have nothing to fear. In a relatively quiet room, the noise cancellation sounds great. Any fans, AC noise, etc is canceled out. However, once you start going about your day, outside noises can still be heard while having the volume 2/3 of the way up.Now that is assuming that the pros are able to stay in your ear. I tend to smile a lot throughout my day and sadly when I do, the airpods slip out. I tried both the medium and the small buds to see if my problem would be fixed. It wasn't.Compared to the gen 2 airpods, the pros have great additions. The noise cancellation and the replacement of the buttons used in previous generations are great. However, the pros do lack when it comes to fit, noise cancellation, and price. Additionally, they are not the prettiest. The short neck looks awkward and out of place.I recommend that you try before you buy. Go to an Apple store and ask one of the representatives if you can try on the pros before you buy them. Also, ask them to clean them beforehand. Perform a variety of head movements (depending on how confident you are in public you can try headbanging, head shaking, running in place, etc etc) to make sure that they fit properly. Finally, make sure you smile while you wear them.\n  \n",

Normally I haven\u2019t been comfortable wearing and of the EarPods Apple have sent me with iPhones in the past. An hour at best and I was happy to remove them. These I can wear and have worn for three hours with no need to remove them.Sound wise they aren\u2019t going to make me throw away my Bose Quiet Comfort headphones or even my pair of ten year old Sony Open Ear headphones. But the sound is perfect for background listening of classical orchestra and piano. I love them in the background while reading, doing desk work and even taking my daily hour long outdoor walk. I mostly use transparency mode especially when walking outdoors where safety is a factor. And indoors I don\u2019t need noise quieting.A big advantage with these  Ear Buds is the freedom of movement and long playing time. My main music source is an Apple 11 Pro iPhone and an app I found online with streaming classical music.

However, they do get a bit of getting used to since there's no actual buttons or anything to push on the AirPods.  But get used to the following is not that hard: Using two fingers, squeeze the flat side on each AirPod. You'll hear a click in your ear with each press.Single-press: Pause/playDouble-press: Skip forwardTriple-press: Skip backwardLong-press: Switch between noise cancellation and transparency mode.Another cool feature that's included allows the user to check which ear tip is better to use for you by allowing the software check the quality of the sound.  To run the test, open the Settings app on your iPhone, select Bluetooth and tap on the \"i\" next to the name of your AirPods Pro. Select Ear Tip Fit Test, and then follow the prompts.I ordered a second pair for my better half.\n  \n",
