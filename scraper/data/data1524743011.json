            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    For me, a highlight of an otherwise ill-spent youth was reading mathematician John Casti\u2019s fantastic book \u201cParadigms Lost\u201c. The book came out in the late 1980s and was gifted to my father who was a professor of economics by an adoring student. Its sheer range and humor had me gripped from the first page. Its format is very unique \u2013 Casti presents six \u201cbig questions\u201d of science in the form of a courtroom trial, advocating arguments for the prosecution and the defense. He then steps in as jury to come down on one side or another. The big questions Casti examines are multidisciplinary and range from the origin of life to the nature/nurture controversy to extraterrestrial intelligence to, finally, the meaning of reality as seen through the lens of the foundations of quantum theory. Surprisingly, Casti himself comes down on the side of the so-called many worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum theory, and ever since I read \u201cParadigms Lost\u201d I have been fascinated by this analysis.So it was with pleasure and interest that I came across Sean Carroll\u2019s book that also comes down on the side of the many worlds interpretation. The MWI goes back to the very invention of quantum theory by pioneering physicists like Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. As exemplified by Heisenberg\u2019s famous uncertainty principle, quantum theory signaled a striking break with reality by demonstrating that one can only talk about the world only probabilistically. Contrary to common belief, this does not mean that there is no precision in the predictions of quantum mechanics \u2013 it\u2019s in fact the most accurate scientific framework known to science, with theory and experiment agreeing to several decimal places \u2013 but rather that there is a natural limit and fuzziness in how accurately we can describe reality. As Bohr put it, \u201cphysics does not describe reality; it describes reality as subjected to our measuring instruments and observations.\u201d This is actually a reasonable view \u2013 what we see through a microscope and telescope obviously depends on the features of that particular microscope or telescope \u2013 but quantum theory went further, showing that the uncertainty in the behavior of the subatomic world is an inherent feature of the natural world, one that doesn\u2019t simply come about because of uncertainty in experimental observations or instrument error.At the heart of the probabilistic framework of quantum theory is the wave function. The wave function is a mathematical function that describes the state of the system, and its square gives a measure of the probability of what state the system is in. The controversy starts right away with this most fundamental entity. Some people think that the wave function is \u201cepistemic\u201d, in the sense that it\u2019s not a real object and is simply related to our knowledge \u2013 or our ignorance \u2013 of the system. Others including Carroll think it\u2019s \u201contological\u201d, in the sense of being a real entity that describes features of the system. The fly in the ointment concerns the act of actually measuring this wave function and therefore the state of a quantum system, and this so-called \u201cmeasurement problem\u201d is as old as the theory itself and kept even the pioneers of quantum theory awake.The problem is that once a quantum system interacts with an \u201cobserver\u201d, say a scintillation screen or a particle accelerator, its wave function \u201ccollapses\u201d because the system is no longer described probabilistically and we know for certain what it\u2019s like. But this raises two problems: Firstly, how do you exactly describe the interaction of a microscopic system with a macroscopic object like a particle accelerator? When exactly does the wave function \u201ccollapse\u201d, by what mechanism and in what time interval? And who can collapse the wave function? Does it need to be human observers for instance, or can an ant or a computer do it? What can we in fact say about the consciousness of the entity that brings about its collapse?The second problem is that contrary to popular belief, quantum theory is not just a theory of the microscopic world \u2013 it\u2019s a theory of everything except gravity (for now). This led Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger to postulate his famous cat paradox which demonstrated the problems inherent in the interpretation of the theory. Before measurement, Schr\u00f6dinger said, a system is deemed to exist in a superposition of states while after measurement it exists only in one; does this mean that macroscopic objects like cats also exist in a superposition of entangled states, in case of his experiment in a mixture of half dead-half alive states? The possibility bothered Schr\u00f6dinger and his friend Einstein to no end. Einstein in particular refused to believe that quantum theory was the final word, and there must be \u201chidden variables\u201d that would allow us to get rid of the probabilities if only we knew what they were; he called the seemingly instantaneous entanglement of quantum states \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d. Physicist John Bell put that particular objection to rest in the 1960s, proving that at least local quantum theories could not be based on hidden variables.Niels Bohr and his group of followers from Copenhagen were more successful in their publicity campaign. They simply declared the question of what is \u201creal\u201d before measurement irrelevant and essentially pushed the details of the measurement problem under the rug by saying that the act of observation makes something real. The cracks were evident even then \u2013 the physicist Robert Serber once pointedly pointed out problems with putting the observer on a pedestal by asking if we might regard the Big Bang unreal because there were no observers back then. But Bohr and his colleagues were widespread and rather zealous, and most attempts by physicists like Einstein and David Bohm met with either derision or indifference.Enter Hugh Everett who was a student of John Wheeler at Princeton. Everett essentially applied Occam\u2019s Razor to the problem of collapse and asked a provocative question: What are the implications if we simply assume that the wave function does not collapse? While this avoids asking about the aforementioned complications with measurement, it creates problems of its own since we know for a fact that we can observe only one reality (dead vs alive cat, an electron track here rather than there) while the wave function previously described a mixture of realities. This is where Everett made a bold and revolutionary proposal, one that was as courageous as Einstein\u2019s proposal of the constancy of the speed of light: he surmised that when there is a measurement, the other realities encoded in the wavefunction split off from our own. They simply don\u2019t collapse and are every bit as real as our own. Just like Einstein showed in his theory of relativity that there are no privileged observers, Everett conjectured that there are no privileged observer-created realities. This is the so-called many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.Everett proposed this audacious claim in his PhD thesis in 1957 and showed it to Wheeler. Wheeler was an enormously influential physicist, and while he was famous for outlandish ideas that influenced generations of physicists like Richard Feynman and Kip Thorne, he was also a devotee of Bohr\u2019s Copenhagen school \u2013 he and Bohr had published a seminal paper explaining nuclear fission way back in 1939, and Wheeler regarded Bohr\u2019s Delphic pronouncements akin to those of Confucius \u2013 that posited observer-generated reality. He was sympathetic to Everett but could not support him in the face of Bohr\u2019s objections. Everett soon left theoretical physics and spent the rest of his career doing nuclear weapons research, a chain-smoking, secretive, absentee father who dropped dead of an unhealthy lifestyle in 1982. After a brief resurrection by Everett himself at a conference organized by Wheeler, many-worlds didn\u2019t see much popular dissemination until writers like Casti and the physicist David Deutsch wrote about it.As Carroll indicates, the MWI has a lot of things going for it. It avoids the prickly, convoluted details of what exactly constitutes a measurement and the exact mechanism behind it; it does away with especially thorny details of what kind of consciousness can collapse a wavefunction. It\u2019s elegant and satisfies Occam\u2019s Razor because it simply postulates two entities \u2013 a wave function and a Schr\u00f6dinger equation through which the wave function evolves through time, and nothing else. One can calculate the likelihood of each of the \u201cmany worlds\u201d by postulating a simple rule proposed by Max Born that assigns a weight to every probability. And it also avoids an inconvenient split between the quantum and the classical world, treating both systems quantum mechanically. According to the MWI, when an observer interacts with an electron, for instance, the observer\u2019s wave function becomes entangled with the electron\u2019s and continues to evolve. The reason why we still see only one Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat (dead or alive) is because each one is triggered by distinct random events like the passage of photons, leading to separate outcomes. Carroll thus sees many-worlds as basically a logical extension of the standard machinery of quantum theory. In fact he doesn\u2019t even see the many worlds as \u201cemerging\u201d (although he does see them as emergent); he sees them as always present and intrinsically encoded in the wave function\u2019s evolution through the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.A scientific theory is of course only as good as its experimental predictions and verification \u2013 as a quote ascribed to Ludwig Boltzmann puts it, matters of elegance should be left to the tailor and the cobbler. Does MWI postulate elements of reality that are different from those postulated by other interpretations? The framework is on shakier ground here since there are no clear observable predictions except those predicted by standard quantum theory that would truly privilege it over others. Currently it seems that the best we can say is that many worlds is consistent with many standard features of quantum mechanics. But so are many other interpretations. To be accepted as a preferred interpretation, a theory should not just be consistent with experiment, but uniquely so. For instance, consider one of the very foundations of quantum theory \u2013 wave-particle duality. Wave-particle duality is as counterintuitive and otherworldly as any other concept, but it\u2019s only by postulating this idea that we can ever make sense of disparate experiments verifying quantum mechanics, experiments like the double-slit experiment and the photoelectric effect. If we get rid of wave-particle duality from our lexicon of quantum concepts, there is no way we can ever interpret the results of thousands of experiments from the subatomic world such as particle collisions in accelerators. There is thus a necessary, one-to-one correspondence between wave-particle duality and reality. If we get rid of many-worlds, however, it does not make any difference to any of the results of quantum theory, only to what we believe about them. Thus, at least as of now, many-worlds remains a philosophically pleasing framework than a preferred scientific one.Many-worlds also raises some thorny questions about the multiple worlds that it postulates. Is it really reasonable to believe that there are literally an infinite copies of everything \u2013 not just an electron but the measuring instrument that observes it and the human being who records the result \u2013 splitting off every moment? Are there copies of me both writing this post and not writing it splitting off as I type these words? Is the universe really full of these multiple worlds, or does it make more sense to think of infinite universes? One reasonable answer to this question is to say that quantum theory is a textbook example of how language clashes with mathematics. This was well-recognized by the early pioneers like Bohr: Bohr was fond of an example where a child goes into a store and asks for some mixed sweets. The shopkeeper gives him two sweets and asks him to mix them himself. We might say that an electron is in \u201ctwo places at the same time\u201d, but any attempt to actually visualize this dooms us, because the only notion of objects existing in two places is one that is familiar to us from the classical world, and the analogy breaks down when we try to replace chairs or people with electrons. Visualizing an electron spinning on its axis the way the earth spins on its is also flawed.Similarly, visualizing multiple copies of yourself actually splitting off every nanosecond sounds outlandish, but it\u2019s only because that\u2019s the only way for us to make sense of wave functions entangling and then splitting. Ultimately there\u2019s only the math, and any attempts to cast it in the form of everyday language is a fundamentally misguided venture. Perhaps when it comes to talking about these things, we will have to resort to Wittgenstein\u2019s famous quote \u2013 whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must be silent (or thereof we must simply speak in the form of pictures, as Wittgenstein did in his famous \u2018Tractatus\u2019). The other thing one can say about many-worlds is that while it does apply Occam\u2019s Razor to elegantly postulating only the wave function and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, it raises questions about the splitting off process and the details of the multiple worlds that are similar to those about the details of measurement raised by the measurement problem. In that sense it only kicks the can of complex worms down the road, and in that case believing what particular can to open is a matter of taste. As an old saying goes, nature does not always shave with Occam\u2019s Razor.In the last part of the book, Carroll talks about some fascinating developments in quantum gravity, mainly the notion that gravity can emerge through microscopic degrees of freedom that are locally entangled with each other. One reason why this discussion is fascinating is because it connects many disparate ideas from physics into a potentially unifying picture \u2013 quantum entanglement, gravity, black holes and their thermodynamics. These developments don\u2019t have much to do with many-worlds per se, but Carroll thinks they may limit the number of \u201cworlds\u201d that many worlds can postulate. But it\u2019s frankly difficult to see how one can find definitive experimental evidence for any interpretation of quantum theory anytime soon, and in that sense Richard Feynman\u2019s famous words, \u201cI think it is safe to say that nobody understands quantum mechanics\u201d may perpetually ring true.Very reasonably, many-worlds is Carroll\u2019s preferred take on quantum theory, but he\u2019s not a zealot about it. He fully recognizes its limitations and discuss competing interpretations. But while Carroll deftly dissects many-worlds, I think that the real value of this book is to exhort physicists to take what are called the foundations of quantum mechanics more seriously. It is an attempt to make peace between different quantum factions and bring philosophers into the fold. There\u2019s a huge number of \u201cinterpretations\u201d of quantum theory, some more valid than others, being separated by each other as much by philosophical differences as by physical ones. There was a time when the spectacular results of quantum theory combined with the thorny philosophical problems it raised led to a tendency among physicists to \u201cshut up and calculate\u201d and not worry about philosophical matters. But philosophy and physics have been entwined since the ancient Greeks, and in one sense, one ends where the other begins. Carroll\u2019s book is a hearty reminder for physicists and philosophers to eat at the same table, otherwise they may well remain spooky factions at a distance when it comes to interpreting quantum theory.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This book is certainly worth reading and spending considerable time thinking about.  But once you do, I urge you to address this simple question:  Is Many Worlds Science or Sci-Fi?  I give you my take below.The huge success of QM comes from using the wavefunction to compute mathematical probabilities via the Born Rule.  However in Many Worlds, every possible outcome occurs in some \"world\" ---where is the probability in having everything occur?  Philosophers and some physicists have spent the last 60 years trying to re-introduce the Born Rule into their particular Many Worlds approach because without the Born Rule, Many Worlds is a Dud.  The biggest bragging right of MWs is that it is a minimalist theory using only the deterministic Schrodinger Equation without auxiliary baggage.  But that intellectual purity is soiled by the desperate need to re-introduce the Born probability rules. Carroll attempts to insert the Born Rule into MWs (see p.140-141) by imagining \"self-locating observers \" who can \"see\" the wavefunction (which resides in Hilbert space, not ordinary 3D) and make Born-like probability computations in the (totally undefined and unobservable) infinitesimal interval between the branching of the wavefunction and an observation, whatever that really means.  That tiny interval is the only excuse Carroll cites for inserting probability into MWs.  In fact, he says it\"... gives us an opening to talk about probabilities.  In that moment after branching, both copies of you are subject to self-locating uncertainty....\" (pp. 140-141).  However, other than Carroll's bold assertion that two copies of us exist in this infinitesimal interval and imaginary observers can actually see wavefunction branches, what proof is there for these outlandish claims?  None whatsoever.  It would be ludicrous if standard Quantum Mechanics expected observers to make probabilistic Born calculations by \"seeing\" wavefunction branching --- but this (with a straight face) is Carroll's proposal for Many Worlds!Perhaps it could be argued that these are only meant to be mythical self-locating observers and shouldn't be taken literally. But if so, Carroll's version of Many Worlds rests firmly upon a myth-- not a good look in physics!  The issue of whether these observers are mythical or real is much too important to simply be left, as Carroll does, unaddressed and unanswered.  Philosophers might happily spend decades debating elaborate thought experiments using imaginary \"self-locating observers\", but physicists expect to see observers perform and produce verifiable results.  The major complaint about the Copenhagen interpretation has been its ad hoc rules, but is replacing those rules with Carroll's Sci-Fi characters an advancement?  Assuming that they aren't mythical beings, wouldn't you love to see Carroll's observers perform their Born probability calculations at the Large Hadron Collider in the minuscule time interval between decoherence/ wave function branching and an observation?  Remarkably, Heisenburg seemed to anticipate wild inventions such as 'self-locating observers' when he wrote \"There is no use discussing what could be done if we were other beings than we are.\"  Tell me that doesn't hit the mark when it comes to this book!  But, Carroll simply pretends that his mythical observers answer everything.  In fact, on p.142, Carroll congratulates himself.  In essence, \"Nothing more to see here, just have Faith!\"My criticism here of Carroll's self-locating observers can be carried over to other Many Worlds versions which also invoke phantom 'agents' that are imagined to make 'bets' based on wavefunction branches-- this in an attempt to reclaim Born probability rules.  But, let's see these gamblers get their bets down while the branching is in progress --- that, after all, is their claim.  As Carl Sagan said \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\".  Many Worlds certainly makes extraordinary claims (e.g, you have entered untold numbers of worlds just while reading my post); but the actual evidence for MWs is, at best, underwhelming -- unless hot air (Oxford style) is your idea of evidence!  Of course theory sometimes outpaces experimental validation, but that isn't what is going on here; instead, Many Worlds has the smell of an aging philosophical construct grown unconcerned whether true scientific validation is even possible.  Sadly, here's my bet: We never see anything remotely like MW's phantom \"gamblers\" or fictional \"self-locating observers\", but Carroll's book is far from the last time Sci-Fi straight out of the Twilight Zone is pushed as science.\n  \n",

The author is purely getting off on showing how brilliant he thinks he is to others who purport to know a lot about quantum mechanics.  There is almost nothing here in the form of explaining what he is talking about to someone who is intelligent but isn't part of the quantum vocabulary club.  There's nothing like telling us the \"wave function collapses when it is measured\" to get across absolutely zippo about what he is talking about.Usually, in my experience, hiding behind non-explanatory lingo like this is a sign the writer doesn't really understand the subject matter.The Mr. Carroll should take a good, hard look at \"Relativity Visualized\" by Lewis Carroll Epstein if he wants to get an inkling of how to actually explain scientific phenomena to those who aren't members of the club.  Much as he seems to think relativity is merely an adjunct of Newtonian physics and not of great significance compared to quantum mechanics, maybe he'd get a clue if he'd learn a bit more about it.\n  \n",

Okay, joking aside, I am 230 pages into this 320 page book and I'm having a hard time with what Sean Carroll is putting forward as \"reality.\"  I don't understand just about any of the physics but happily he summarizes in plain English now and again.  So from what I gather, when a scientist takes a measurement in relation to an electron, the observer splits into two equal people, one of whom sees one result and the other one a different result.  Okay, but is it just that person who split or everyone else too?  If it's everyone, do scientists have the right to keep splitting me without my consent?  Also, what happens if 10 or 100 scientists all do the experiment at the same time?  What happens when the split is made and then one of the versions does the experiment again?  This is getting very complicated and very convoluted.  At one point in the book Carroll also states that in some worlds, scientists will get the wrong answers (it's just the way it works with the \"Many Worlds\" model).  But how does Carroll know he's not in one of those worlds?  This is really just all very confusing.  It seems to me that we're too early in the game to think we've figured it all out yet.  There's tons of science still to be performed in the years and decades and centuries to come.

There might be something to \u201cMany-Worlds\u201d theory, but Carroll completely rejects the idea that quantum physics has anything to do Consciousness and Will.  It\u2019s the massive error of this book.  Experiences have everything to do with Cognition; thus Will.  For a more in depth read in this, I recommend Alexander Wendt\u2019s Quantum Mind and Social Science.  Wendt \u201cwills\u201d in sharp contrast to the arguments in Something Deeply Hidden (pages 214-219).It\u2019s currently mainstream to give credence to our \u201cconsciousness not being quantum phenomenon.\u201d  I\u2019m disappointed with the claim that quantum mechanics has nothing to do with consciousness.  Organisms are quantum mechanical and the senses connecting them to the external world have a non-local aspect - I don\u2019t see why Many-Worlds would be against Quantum Cognition.Schopenhauer:  Will objectifies itself in the world.Experience is private. Quantum coherence is Life.\u201c\u2018[S]ome microscopic processes happened that caused branching, and on different branches you end up making different decisions,\u2019 rather than \u2018you made a decision, which caused the wave function of the universe to branch.\u2019\u201d  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a preference, I think both are correct.\u201c[M]ost of our thinking has nothing to do with entanglement and the branching of the wave function.\u201d  I sharply disagree.  The universe is one wave function in Hilbert space.  Everythingis entangled in its wave function, and every branch a part.I\u2019m hoping that one day Carroll will change his mind.  He just published this book, but he could have at least researched more on consciousness and will, than to outright deny its significance in quantum theory without any analysis.We have a world to create, sustain, and/or transform - not negate.Carroll reads like an arrogant know it all.  Often in his book he speaks of a \u201cwe\u201d as if it were an organism - that he\u2019s part of - that speaks the from the righteous and empirical standpoint of the quantum physics community elite.I\u2019m deeply troubled that I was fooled by the title and synopsis, and into buying and supporting him via my purchase.I highly recommend different works in the realm of quantum physics.  If you do end up reading this, I wonder if you will find much value past page 214.\n  \n",

By the way all of our great University Doctors in all the basic sciences and liberal arts ought to be the highest paid professionals in the \u201ccosmos\u201d. The only down side to Sean Carroll\u2019s book suffers from the same problem of all other popular books of physics. Please include the equations. You don\u2019t have to derive or manipulate the equations, just present the equations then below each equation show in words how to read each symbol of the equation going from left to right. You would be astonished at what people could learn from just knowing how to read the equations. Often times I get the feeling that physicists and mathematicians are trying to protect their \u201csecret code\u201d. It seems that they really don\u2019t want the general reader, or the educated reader to really understand what they are talking about.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I think this is probably closer to a 4.5 star than 5 star rating for me, but I only have integer values. I have a lot of things I don't agree with Professor Carroll, but he has great explanations and makes it clear where he is speculating. That gets it the final star for me.Carroll is a very clear and lucid writer, and that is very helpful for a book like this. He goes over quantum mechanics, quantum interpretations, and a possible way to look at quantum gravity. This is all written excellently and engagingly. Carroll is a proponent of the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) or Everett interpretation. This interpretation says that we have the wavefunction, and when we apply the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and get superposition, that is what happens. Our entire universe is a superposition of eigenstates of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. There are many branches that effectively never affect each other, and so we call each branch a separate universe. Hence many worlds/universes.I tend not to find this to be as convincing. I like Chad Orzel's Metaphorical Worlds Interpretation better, because this seems like a better way of understanding what is going on. MWI advocates tend to claim that this version is the simplest, because all we have is the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. I think that they add extra suppositions about how to understand measurements as axioms. When we do measurements we don't see superpositions (whatever that would even mean), we see something happen with 100% probability. As Sabine Hossenfelder (and Peter Woit, and others) point out, the MWI proponent doesn't really solve this problem by saying on some branch the detector will see the measurement with 100%. But then, you need to update your calculations using the detector on the branch where the process did happen, then do calculations from there. Notice that figuring out which branch you are on does not involve solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. There are reasonable ways of doing calculations from looking at branches, but this requires rules. Thus, saying that MWI only uses the Schr\u00f6dinger equation seems incorrect to me. You still have to figure out which branch you are on in order to make predictions. The main point that everything is quantum (so we should try and derive classical results from quantum phenomena) seems sound though.I also am not so sure on the quantum foundations investigating people being looked down on angle. I'd like more historical proof than the anecdotes given in the book. Also, Peter Woit and others have shown that the quote about quantum foundations papers being blanket rejected by Physical Review is missing context that I think is crucial. It was not just about quantum foundations papers, but any papers and it is not clear it was implemented because of quantum foundations. (See the blog Not Even Wrong on \"Regarding Papers about Fundamental Theories\")My other critiques are that \"taking equations seriously\" seems like a slogan rather than a good thing. Maybe it is because I was trained as a computational physicist, but trusting equations often leads to numerical gobbledygook for solutions. You trust number crunching like that at your own risk, as you need initial conditions and all sorts of things to be right to ensure your equations go to the correct solution in the regime you are interested in. Equations seem to be approximations of reality no matter how deep we go, and so I remain distrustful of those who say we should trust the Schr\u00f6dinger equation because it is \"exact\" (how would we know? clearly it is only an approximation, anyway, because of gravity...). Besides, if we think there is more than the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to nature, then why would we take it as the equation to base all our physical intuitions off of?While I think looking at quantum foundations is a good thing, I don't think differing quantum interpretations seem all that much of a problem yet. When they yield different experimental results that can be tested, then I think it's a problem. Also, despite people loving to say that Newtonian physics doesn't have interpretational issues, I think there are big interpretational issues, it's just they have been superseded because we have better theories (special and general relativity and quantum physics) . Newtonian physics allows infinite velocities (thus you must know the state of everything in the universe to be sure that you can figure out what happens in the future or the past. Also, I mean that objects can be accelerated to arbitrary velocities in finite time), it can have solutions that are not unique (see Norton's dome), and as touched on in the book, force at a distance is a problem for gravitation in Newtonian physics if you believe in a certain type of locality.The quantum suicide discussion and problems of identity struck me as okay but not totally convincing. If you are okay with a being with essentially the same history and memories as you continuing to be conscious (whatever that means to you), then that will occur in the MWI and you can exploit that. If you are the type that is okay with a being with your memories (\"you\" in probably all relevant senses), then the suicide experiment will work, but I see no reason why you would want to do it. You'd still hurt others that care about you and if you don't care about that, then you can just wait it out as you get old. You should expect to be the oldest person because the only beings with your memories that will remain will be those who grow to be the oldest person in their universe.A side question I have is why people don't worry about merging of branches. The book answers my question in one way, using an entropy metaphor (entropy must increase). But that is for the whole universe, and I can believe that about the MWI. But aren't there local cases where similar branches \"recohere\"? Just as I can have a subsystem have its entropy decrease, but the overall entropy of the system increases?Despite my critiques, I would definitely recommend the book. It comes from an MWI advocate angle, but Carroll is usually careful about what he says and is simply an advocate and doesn't straw man his opponents. He even talks about superdeterminism without calling it a \"cosmic conspiracy\" which wins points from me (I'm not really an advocate of superdeterminism, but I think it gets an undeserved bad reputation). Plus the quantum gravity part is excellent. It points out it is speculative when it needs to, and explains fields and particles very well. Carroll answers many questions I have had about the MWI, and he certainly outlines why it's a reasonable position to take. I just don't think it's clear that it is the best interpretation. If you'd like to know more about MWI and quantum mechanics, this book is an excellent addition.\n  \n",

I should have been warned - the critical WSJ review which brought the book to my attention had highlighted this, but, stupidly, I had ignored the warning.Rather like Frasier's prospective date, the book is initially most alluring. The first few chapters give a commendably clear description of quantum mechanics. However, the religious fanaticism presents itself in chapter 6 in the form of the many-worlds theory. The author is relentless: this MUST be the only explanation of the mysteries thrown up by quantum mechanics.I read on for a while, but it dawned on me that, whilst Frasier was obligated to complete the journey, I was not.

But it seems like there were many questions the author did not address or handwaved on:(1) Conservation of mass/energy. How can two multiple copies of the universe conserve mass/energy if each on is a clone. The author sees to say the copies are exact but at other times claims the cloned universes are thinner in some sense.(2) How does whole universe get cloned? What is mechanism? Just building a shed in the backyard takes a week. How is an entire university almost exactly duplicated instantaneously gazillion times a second?(3) How does morality work? There is one universe in which a particular person robs a bank, and another universe in which they do not rob a bank. So everyone does the bad thing and the good thing both. And equally nuymber of universes where they do the bad thing and the good thing?(4) So to allow an ant to choose to decide to go left or to go right, two entire universes have to be created, with billions of galaxies filled with trillions of stars, just seems like a gigantic waste of resources .. Every ant that turns left or right--trillions of ants.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Carroll show that one can carefully explain many aspects of reality---in his case the physics particles and the cosmos---without using any math. The math is important many to make sure that what you say without it is actually correct. It's like when you read the label of ingredients in a food product, they don't tell you how they verified their truth in the lab, but you can usually believe them. Carroll does a very good job of this.Now Carroll has a candidly expressed goal of convincing you of the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM).  Well, I don't believe it for a moment, but I still liked the books a lot. It's like reading St. Thomas Aquinas or Martin Buber. Or like having a double bourbon at the end of a long day. Somehow...There is not a grain of support for the Many Worlds (MW) interpretation. Not a grain, for or against. It is pure metaphysics to believe or disbelieve. Carroll argues that MW is just taking the Schrodinger equation (SchrE) seriously, without 'collapse.' First of all, this is just false. The  SchrE describes the evolution of a wave equation is Hilbert space. But we live in four dimensional spacetime, not Hilbert space. Attributing 'reality' to the wave equation, and alternative 'worlds' to the entities that are entangled and superimposed in the wave equation is a monster leap of faith for which there is no compelling argument.The major illegitimate assumption of MW is that every physical system has a Hamiltonian. Once you admit that you are gone. The decay of a particle, for instance, can be registered by a macro instrument (or Wigner's friend), and since the latter has a Hamiltonian, the whole system goes into superposition. But why must the instrument have a Hamiltonian? There is no reason in QM.QM assumes the system under study has a Hamiltonian. In many cases, we can find the Hamiltonian and show that the Schrodinger equation predicts. But there is no formula for finding the Hamiltonian of a system. Does my computer have a Hamiltonian? I doubt it. No one has ever found such a thing.QM seems to work universally because whenever we can find a plausible Hamiltonian, it works. But we mostly can't eve come close to finding a Hamiltonian for a complex system. We can create fake cardboard Hamiltonians by. say, representing the NY State lottery as a mechanism with a million integer outcomes. But that is not the NY State Lottery.There really is a classical world. We all live in it. There really is also a quantum world. How they fit together is one of the great mysteries of modern thought. We just don't know, and theologies like the Many Worlds approach impede our progress towards a real understanding.\n  \n",

To say the observer causes a branching instead of a collapse is useless.  I'm sure it makes the math better since the collapse is not a continuous function while the branching is, but somehow the specialness of observing is still the cause.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I have to recommend this book because it is naturally well written, as expected from Sean Carrell. I\u2019m a big fan of Carrell\u2019s wonderful Youtube channel, and his books in general.What I find most distasteful however, is this implied  \u201crealist\u201d view of \u201cmany worlds\u201d,... as if quantum mechanics (QM) predicts actual splitting multiple Worlds. It\u2019s a disservice, in my opinion, to present to a lay audience, such an interpretation, as if it were scientific, when in point of fact,.... it is literally the definition of metaphysics.It is not even necessary to regard Everett\u2019s interpretation, in such a metaphysically leaning Realist sense with actual splitting of Real worlds;... one could rather simply consider it in the form of a \u2018consistent histories\u2019 or \u2018conditional probability\u2019 derivation of the Schrodinger equation.With respect to philosophical foundations, what was discovered with QM, is not any metaphysical worlds, but rather that we can\u2019t get out of our own epistemological way... that \u201cindependent reality\u201d while objective, is conceptually formless, and that to gain predictive knowledge de facto means \u2018to add conceptual form\u2019,... given the necessarily macroscopic experimental arrangement,...  the epistemic conditions for observability to be at all possible given the nature of mind,...i.e. failure of counterfactual definiteness, contextuality, Heisenberg\u2019s cut, Born rule interpretation of the wavefunction, the fact that decoherence does not solve the measurement problem.\"There is no way to remove the observer, us, from our perception of the world, which is created through our sensory processing and through the way we think and reason. Our perception \u2014 and hence the observations upon which our theories are based is not direct, but rather is shaped by a kind of lens, the interpretive structure of our brains\" - S. HawkingAs Carrell implied in the book, the Many Worlds Interpretation is \u2018trivial\u2019 [Hawking] in the sense that it relies only upon the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\u2019s deterministic evolution of the wavefunction. But such an attitude presumes no additional interpretation,... as if mathematical idealism could legitimately supplant the job of the physicist....\u201cAs far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.\u201d \u2013 Albert EinsteinThere is an historical analogy to make this point; The great mathematician Hermann Weyl critiqued Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity on the basis that, invoking idealized rods and clocks was inconsistent with the form of GR as a local field theory, and was a remnant of Euclidean based physics. Weyl was invoking mathematical idealism in expecting Riemannian geometry to stand on its own as a physics theory. Einstein, the proper physicists that he was, in response argued that the application of Riemannian geometry to the physical world presupposes a means of empirically confirming it, and so presupposes the existence of ideal rods and ideal clocks in order to substantiate a physical meaning for the concepts of 'unit distance' and 'unit time'. Likewise, the wavefunction and the Schrodinger equation describing its evolution, presupposes a means of empirically confirming it,.... presupposes a conceptual form, given the necessarily macroscopic experimental arrangement,... epistemic conditions for observability to be at all possible.All interpretations of QM that are empirically indistinguishable, are merely different ways of moving the probability component from one place to another in the formalism, and/or invoking metaphysical entities of one sort or another in order to deny the epistemic component of measurement, and therefore in conflating Measurement with \u2018Quantum Interaction in Independent Reality\u2019. It\u2019s rather ironic that Carrell\u2019s MWI invokes an admitted epistemic interpretation for \u201cself-locating observers\u201d to reintroduce the Born rule through the back door of the formalism,....and therefore admitting a measurement-problem that is effectively equivalent to the original.Why not just avoid all the unscientific \u2018metaphysical baggage\u2019 [Wheeler], the mathematical idealism, and the obfuscated distinction between a Measurement and Quantum Interaction,..... and acknowledge on the front end,... the empirically substantiated distinction between an Observer dependent Measurement and Wavefunction description? And admit the necessity of the Born rule probabilistic interpretation, of an epistemic wavefunction? Epistemology is at least in principle, scientific, while metaphysics is intrinsically, not.\"The doctrine that the world is made up of objects whose existence is independent of human consciousness [epistemology] turns out to be in conflict with quantum mechanics and with facts established by experiment\" - B. d'Espagnat\n  \n",

And what could be more cutting edge than quantum physics, although the basics have been around for a century or more.Carroll is an accomplished theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a well-established author. He is also a proponent of the Many-Worlds school of the quantum world. (Yes, you exist in many worlds but you will never meet yourself.) The book is well written and intended for an audience broader than the professional physicist. And bravo for that. Alas, however, try as he might, this book will be a slog for the average lay reader.The physics that most of us learned in school is all about particles. Quantum physics, on the other hand, is all about waves and fields. In such a fluid world, the sheer act of measuring something changes whatever it is we\u2019re measuring. (Akin to trying to catch the proverbial greased pig.)Part of the problem that scientists, particularly physicists, face is that their only vehicle for communicating what they learn is language. But language is a human convention. It is not of nature like oxygen and rain. And it is, by definition, symbolic. That\u2019s why we invented it, to facilitate communication.The universe, however, is not a human convention. It is nature itself. Nor is it symbolic. It is the universe. That\u2019s about as real as it gets.Scientists attempt to get around this by creating their own language and system of notation. It sounds impressive, but it doesn\u2019t quite bridge the gap. \u201cIs the picture we\u2019ve sketched, where the entanglement between degrees of freedom somehow comes together to define the geometry of our approximately classical spacetime, actually on the right track?\u201d He ultimately answers that complex question with the simplest of answer. \u201cNobody knows for sure.\u201dIn the end, my conclusion is that scientists are not as far along as many would have us believe. They know a lot, and there are many brilliant minds working through the issues, but \u201ca lot\u201d is a relative calibration. There is much they don\u2019t know.In a way, I admit, that is reassuring to me. I am not a religious man. I am, however, a philosopher. I am comfortable with the unknown.

Following Carroll's presentation he makes it clear that this understanding inevitably leads to the Multi-World outcome. However (as I included in my headline), there are MANY assumptions that have to be adopted to come to this conclusion. I'm now reading Lee Smolin's new book \"Einstein's Unfinished Revolution: The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum\" in which he states that the Everett understanding is an anti-realist approach, and is just simply wrong. He adopts a realist approach and maintains that the Multi-World outcome is nonsense. I have not finished Smolin's book yet, so I'm not sure he makes a compelling argument - but I'm inclined to agree with Smolin - so far. These two books make reading about the latest thoughts and ideas about Quantum Mechanics real fun. I suspect I'll write a review about Smolin's book once I finish it.\n  \n",

Or, phrased another way, whether such \"real\" actual objects and interactions actually exist (as denied, for example, by the standard \"Copenhagen\" interpretation of QM).The discussion of the so-called \"Many Worlds Interpretation\" is, of course, excellent.  And the book should be praised for presenting an intelligent, detailed --and serious-- discussion of the topic, accessible to any thoughtful, careful reader.But to my mind, the book is equally (or, perhaps more) valuable for laying out and explaining the actual underlying questions that underlie this whole topic; moreover, the issue that the \"Many Worlds Interpretation\" intends to address and, perhaps more to the point, a topic that is almost never seriously addressed even in university courses in QM.(If I may suggest another book that covers much of the same material (i.e. concerning the \"Measurement Problem\"), but with additional focus on the detailed history of the discussion, the reader may wish to take a look at Adam Becker's \"What is Real?\")\n  \n",

Although there are no bras or kets, be warned that reading this book is not easy. You have to follow a sustained chain of logic and some \u201ccartoon equations.\u201d If you follow through, you can appreciate MWI fairly well.Carrol\u2019s preference for MWI boils down to aesthetics. According to Carroll you have to accept that there is no Heisenberg cut between the classical world and the quantum. Reality is a quantum wave function. No collapse. No measurement problem. The price you pay for this simplicity is accepting those many worlds. Carroll also uses much of the book to explain why many of the criticisms of MWI are unfounded.My biggest disappointment is that Carroll fails to explain why we should care. How does it change our understanding of the world? In the last third of the book, Carroll proposes that MWI might explain spacetime as an emergent phenomenon, but most of it is speculative handwaving. I would rather that Carroll would have used the remainder of the book to explain how MWI can help me understand actual quantum phenomena like quantum computing, quantum cloning, quantum cryptography, and such.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Sadly, it seems, the quest to make sense of quantum mechanics is not a high-status item in modern physics, and in some quarters, it is even disparaged, according to Carroll. Let this not stop the author from pursuing this matter in more detail. There are three main messages conveyed by the book: it should be understandable, real progress has been made toward understanding it, and thirdly, all of this really matters.We are introduced to some basic concepts such as the measurement problem, the wave function, probabilities, and amplitudes associated with the wave function, Schrodinger\u2019s equation, which then leads to a discussion of what is called austere quantum mechanics or AQM. This is more commonly known as the Everett or Many-Worlds model. In a measurement, we are dealing with one wave function, which includes the object of measurement (perhaps an electron) and the measurement device. The Everett formulation basically states every version of quantum mechanics features just two things: the wave function and Schrodinger\u2019s equation, which governs how wave functions evolve in time. These ingredients \u201cprovide a complete empirically adequate account of the world.\u201d Reality is described by a smoothly evolving wave function and nothing else. There is a lot to learn here. We gain an understanding of Planck\u2019s discovery of the connection of energy to frequency, which leads to Planck\u2019s constant, the Planck length, and Planck time. In a subsequent chapter, we learn that position and momentum don\u2019t even exist at the same time. There is a spread of possibilities for both quantities, neither having a definite value- very strange. This leads to what is called the uncertainty principle. \u201cIf position is concentrated near some location, momentum is completely undermined, and vice versa.\u201d Then there is complementarity, which allows more than two ways of looking at a quantum system. For example, electrons can have particle-like or wave-like properties, just not at the same time. One of the degrees of freedom (explained in the book) is spin. The author\u2019s discussion on this is interesting, if not a bit confusing to me. The next discussion is on entanglement and a feature of this is the no-signaling theorem.In section two, we delve more deeply into the Everettian world. Here every part of the universe is treated according to the rules of quantum mechanics, including the observers within it. There is a single quantum state, what Everett called the \u201cuniversal wave function.\u201d There is no Copenhagen collapse of the wave function or classical realms. The measuring apparatus itself evolves into a superposition, entangled with the state of the thing being observed. In this case, the other possible measurement outcomes exist. This is ultimately interpreted to mean branching into separate never-to-interact worlds. The collapse we see is only apparent, due to dechoerence splitting of the wave function. In a subsequent chapter the author discusses why probabilities enter into things considering that the Schrodinger equation is perfectly deterministic. In Chapter 8, we are given more insight to this many-worlds idea via a discussion between a hypothetical Alice and her father. Following this, we learn of some alternatives to the many-worlds theory. Three competitors are discussed: dynamical collapse, hidden variables, and epistemic theories. There some other theories that the author discusses, such as Bohmian mechanics, which posits hidden variables; and there is the epistemic approach, an example of which is QBism.By section III, we get into a discussion of space and the concepts of emergence and locality. We obtain an interesting take on what the \u201cvacuum\u201d means in quantum field theory. There is a lot to learn here if you are unfamiliar. I could probably reread some of these sections numerous times until it all sinks in. An interesting point made here is called the cosmological constant problem: the quantum contribution to the vacuum energy (including only contributions of wavelengths longer than the Planck length) gives a finite answer which is ten to the 122nd power greater than the value actually observed. Another interesting point is that empty space is \u201cdescribed by a stationary, unchanging quantum state, where nothing is happening from moment to moment.\u201d This is contrary to the notion that the vacuum is full of \u201cquantum fluctuations.\u201d By page 268 of the book, we begin to leave the edge of what is safely understood and venture into uncharted territory. There is some discussion of black holes and entropy; we learn of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, for example, and that black holes have a special property: \u201cthey represent the highest-entropy states we can have in any given size region of space.\u201d We also learn that gravity changes things. The author states that gravity leads to a \u201cfinite number of quantum degrees of freedom,\u201d which \u201cimplies a finite-dimensional Hilbert space,\u201d that in turn, \u201cimplies that there is some finite number of branches of the wave function.\u201d This would make the number of worlds in the many-worlds theory finite not infinite. Piece of cake!As you can see, the reading level for this is a bit difficult unless you have some learning in the field. So, in conclusion, it seems that \u201cwe reached a point where it is no longer practical to draw a bright line between the quantum and classical realms. Everything is quantum.\u201d\n  \n",

I think it\u2019s great that Sean takes the time and has the ability to explain quantum mechanics to the lay persons.  Although I can\u2019t do the math, I understand quantum mechanics more now than I ever thought was possible. I am puzzled with one major claim of his or the many worlds interpretation \u2026.I don\u2019t understand why the universe has to branch after a quantum measurement has happened and the particle has been entangled to the environment.In his book he talks about only 1 wave function, which is that of the universe and that a lone particle unentangled from the universe has it\u2019s own wave function.  Why can\u2019t that just be it?  No added many worlds. No branching. Unentangle particles have a separate wave function.  Particles that entangle with the environment has their wave function merged back with the one wave function of the universe.\n  \n",
