            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I picked up a copy of this book because my students were reading it for their English class and I like to throw them off by slipping literary references into Algebra class. I figured it was a short book, it wouldn't take along time, and it would give me a sense for what they were learning in their other classes (and maybe spark some cross-curricular ideas!)Oh man, was that a mistake. It didn't do any of those things (and apparently kids these days don't actually read their summer reading, what a shame). Instead, I fell deeply in love with this book and have read it three times in the last two years. It's the kind of book that works on more than one level - you have your hero who goes on an adventure, learning from a wise mentor, hitting roadblocks, coming to know himself and the world around him before realizing that his true treasure was in himself all along, and if that's all you get out of the book, then that's fine, but there's more going on here.The difficulty of the book is figuring out what that more is. The book constantly suggests and hints at lessons that seem at once a comment on ethics and metaphysics, history and anthropology, post-colonialist critique and folk fairy tale. Biblical allusions abound next to Islamic lessons on the nature of God while institutions and mysticism are equally likely to be evoked and revoked. There's always the sense as you read that there is something lingering under the surface, but the minute that you try to grab it (or write it in a review) it seems to disappear.That seems to be the point of the book, that the message is clear if you read it without trying to grab it. Hold it loosely and it comes easily, try to describe it and it flits away. The book is allusive; it works on you without seeming to, and at the end you're left both satisfied as the adventure concludes and also wanting more, or perhaps wanting to do more. Perhaps that's why I like this book so much - it doesn't yield its secrets easily, or perhaps it yields it too easily, and you finish wondering where your heart and your treasure lie and what your personal legend might be. I imagine that this book might say more about its reader than its text: when you know your own heart and your own journey well enough, perhaps this will only remain a passing, although enjoyable fairy tale.\n  \n",

I'm in such a place where I'm trying to discover what I am supposed to do. I'm a spiritual person, and I really felt that this book is talking to me. I'm sure everyone would resonate differently with the book. But the theme and the message is there.I'm not done reading it yet, but when I started. I read like the first 80 pages nonstop. Really soak in the message and lessons. I can't wait to finish this book.EDIT:So, I finally finished the book. And wow, never would have I thought, a book would have such an impact on me. It's a simple tale but filled with lessons if you are seeking it. I read it in like 3 sittings. I'm not much of a reader and just starting to appreciate it, and I am glad this was one of the books I read. Love it.\n  \n",

Kinda like Dave Ramsey\u2019s stuff\u2014if you\u2019re already living life like you should then this tale is monotonous.You can read the synopsis. The story is ludicrous from the beginning, but I persevered through the gypsy and the king and the desert and the oasis and then the alchemist. Treasure?

Good grief.This is my take. Instead of the sheep and Bedouins and emerald tablets the author would have been better putting his magical life altering quotes in a little book.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The Alchemist is a gripping narrative about a young Andalusian shepherd named Santiago and his journey to find the greatest treasure in the world. This charming story follows Santiago on his journey to Egypt, after having a recurring dream of finding treasure there. Santiago travels across great distances and encounters crazy adventures in his quest for gold. Little does he know that the ultimate treasure is actually found deep within.This dream was so prophetic that Santiago genuinely believed this was his ultimate goal in life. After deciding to travel to a Romani fortune-teller in a nearby town to discover its meaning, a gypsy woman tells him that there is a treasure in the Pyramids in Egypt.Towards the beginning of his journey, Santiago meets an old king, named Melchizedek, who advises him to sell his sheep in order to travel to Egypt. He also introduces the idea of a Personal Legend, stating that your Personal Legend, \u201cis what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.\u201dThe Alchemist Physical CoverAlong the journey, Santiago meets an Englishman who is in search of an Alchemist and together they continue their search for treasure. As they travel through the Sahara desert, Santiago meets and falls in love with a beautiful Arabian woman named Fatima. After a brief period of time, Santiago asks Fatima to marry him, but she tells him that she will only marry him after he finds his treasures. Perplexed by this, Santiago later learns that true love will not stop one\u2019s Personal Legend, and if it does, it is not true love.Eventually Santiago meets a lone alchemist who teaches him about Personal Legends. He shares his wisdom that people want to find only the treasure of their Personal Legends but not the Personal Legend itself. The alchemist states,\u201cThose who don\u2019t understand their Personal Legends will fail to comprehend their teachings.\u201dIf you are looking for a book that will inspire courage, this is the one. No matter what your dream, goals or visions are, the universe will conspire to help you achieve the things you want, regardless of how insurmountable the task seems. You must live the life you truly desire to its fullest extent if you want to look back on a life having worth lived.The essential message is that treasure is more worthy than gold.Read more here: [...]\n  \n",

I've watched several interviews of him in the brazillian media throughout these years, and I always found him a bit of a crook with his \"magician talk\". Anyway I decided to give it a try.  After all, just like the \"Elvis is still alive\" myth, tens of millions of fans cannot all be wrong at same time. Right?To be completelly honest, I really wanted to love this book, but what I've found is it is actually rather bland and overall disappointing considering all the following the book and the author have. It simply did not live up to my expectations.Yes there are some good life lessons in there (hence the 3 stars) but because the sheer amount of positive reviews about this book I ended up approaching it with an inflated expectation. Being one the most sold and translated books of all time, I was hoping \"The Alchemist\" to be life changing, world shattering, an eternal classic, or at least a book that would be very inspiring and I'd remember for a long time and could recommend with flying stars to all my friends.Sadly, the book came up short on several fronts. It is not written in an engaging fashion, the author is not capable of transporting you to or immersing you into the mystical places where the story happens, the narrative sometimes becomes \"jittery\" jumping from one character or setting to the other up to the point I had to re-read some passages to be sure where I was standing in the story.  The ending is also rather bland... Just to name a few of the shortcomings.Perhaps all of this is due to the fact this was the author's first work?  Im not sure...Overall I'd say the book is not a complete throw away, there is some value in there, but it is way overrated IMO.Bottom line is that in being overrated, I approached it with a huge expectation which went frustrated and that reflects my medium to low rating.Im still not quite sure why so many positive reviews about it...Perhaps it is just me and my rather inflated expectation or even negative bias towards the author, or maybe it could be also that the world is filled with people who are desperate for the most simple and basic encouragements like the ones the book provides (follow your dreams, dont give in to fear etc...).In that case, maybe (just maybe) the book might be a good example of why the self-help industry thrives on these days, preying on peoples desire for finding meaning and purpose in life.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The book condition was perfect and arrived very quickly, so no complaints there. I will even give points for the book binding and the paper used. As for the content, however, this book is awful.If you want a spiritual journey with depth read Siddhartha, or the Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter, or a host of stories from Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. If you want Dr. Wayne Dyer's platitudes wrapped in the most overt metaphors and cliches humanly possible: buy this book. The premise of the book can be summed up in one quote:\"[W]hen you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\" Other ways you might sum this book up are: \"Be all you can be.\" \"Just do it.\" \"What the mind [or heart] can conceive, it [will] achieve.\" \"Live in the moment.\" \"The answer lies within.\" One of the most climactic moments in the story is where Santiago--who has been learning to convene with \"The Soul of the World\"--stands on top of a dune and becomes one with the wind. The problem is, that even as a work of fiction and not an *actual* self-help book, the story comes across as shallow and so overtly New Age that it borders on the ridiculous. Coelho (mis)appropriates religious texts at his leisure and binds them to his thesis that the \"Language of the World\" is that all things are one.Moreover, magic and the supernatural as elements of good fiction are one thing (e.g. anything by Toni Morrison or Gabriel Garcia Marquez's, One Hundred Years of Solitude) and The Alchemist incorporates those certainly but what the book lacks is subtlety. Coehlo's problem (cliches and platitudes aside) is assuming a remarkable lack of intelligence on behalf of his reader. All the metaphors are laid out and every lesson is the same: follow your dreams, er, I mean your \"Personal Legend.\" Even the capitalization is ridiculous and gives a faux sense of importance to ideas that are so vapid they would be funny if Coehlo did not peddle them as legitimate.I cannot stress enough how terrible this book is. From preposterous romantic drivel to all the babbling about listening to one's heart, you'd be just as well off watching day time pop-psychologists. The problem with platitudes and cliches is that in times of actual distress, suffering, pain, anxiety, worry, doubt, loss, etc., they are shown for what they are: nothing. And in a way this book is dangerous because it risks convincing us that nothing should stand in the way of what we want and that our only guide is our sense and the ability to \"read the omens\" (whatever that may mean). This risks making others pawns in our game of self-defined self-fulfillment and does nothing for those who have desperate, pressing needs, and who cannot be succored by some half-baked consolation that \"the universe\" is conspiring for them.\n  \n",

These days, I instead find this book dangerously inspiring. The premise is that everyone has their own unique grand treasure to pursue, their own Personal Legend, and that the universe conspires to help them in their quest, if only they stay focused on the prize and don't give up when the universe also tests their desire for the treasure. Spoiler alert: The book is about a shepherd boy whose treasure is unknowingly right where he is at, but he has to travel the world to find it. Along the way he gains wisdom, learns languages, and finds love-- added bonuses that he is tempted to be content with as treasures apart from the greatest treasure he is pursuing.\"'When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I\u2019ve discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve.'\u201dI found a kindred spirit with the shepherd boy who had a wanderlust. I think we all identify along the way with those characters who grew content or gave up pursuing their Personal Legends.\u201cWe are afraid of losing what we have, whether it\u2019s our life or our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand.\u201d\"'People are afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel that they don\u2019t deserve them, or that they\u2019ll be unable to achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but weren\u2019t, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly.'\u201d\"'There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.'\u201d\u201c'That\u2019s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.'\u201dAn alchemist recommended this book to me. I give it 4.5 stars out of 5, it is pretty good for short fiction. I do not know if I will read any of Coelho's other works; I have heard they are all written similarly. I'm told I need to re-read this one periodically to get more meaning from it-- the author says in the foreword he does that every so often. Read it for yourself.\n  \n",

This book is one of the most influential books I've ever read and I liked how it was a story about an adventure, but also incorporated spirituality and self-improvement. I would most definitely recommend this book to a friend or anyone looking for clarity throughout their life journey. I feel as if the book provided me with a positive insight on how to live life to the fullest. One specific aspect of the book that stuck with me was the idea that once we decide to search for our purpose in life, the whole universe will help us. I was also able to recognize that many individuals will struggle is recognizing what their purpose is. It is okay for your Personal Legend to change based on the events that occur throughout your life, but it is important to always be working toward and striving to achieve a goal. The Alchemist is a good reminder that if we, as individuals, do not seek to find our purpose or destiny due to fear, we will forever be unsatisfied. The one thing I love about this book is that it can be geared toward all ages. You are never too young to understand that we should listen to our heart and chase after our dreams. Lastly, I find it so interesting that this text was so beautifully translated from Portuguese and has the ability to powerfully deliver a message in almost 70 other languages. The power of words is amazing! Overall, a great read and I plan to reread this book in the future!\n  \n",

This is such s fully self - centered view of life that I'm not honestly surprised so many love it. The whole \"It's all about me and my feelings\" creates a very selfish and self - involved person who makes little impact. And while the main character did interact with others in the story, it was all a coincidence that their lives were improved at all because the character did very little for anyone but himself.

And also it was one of the books on heavy discount a while back. So I picked up an ebook version and eventually got around to reading, without any real idea what I was in for. It\u2019s the story of a Spanish shepherd boy, who has some mystical experiences and goes on a quest across North Africa to the pyramids.As someone pretty involved in religion (Catholicism) this seemed very light and fluffy to me, if generally based on ideas and ideals I consider to be true. Everyone\u2019s life has a purpose. God sees everything and is in control of it all. The world is a good and beautiful place, if perilous. Seeking to do God\u2019s will in your life will bring you the greatest possible satisfaction. All this plays out in the simple story of the shepherd and his quest. But, it\u2019s *very* simple. Doubts are minimal, obstacles are easily overcome, omens and miracles are abundant. This is not much like the real life most seekers face. So, while I think this might be a good book for a depressed agnostic wondering if their life has meaning... it\u2019s going to need some follow up with some real sustenance afterward. If it was this easy, everyone would be pursuing their \u201cPersonal Legend\u201d and nobody would have any doubts.\n  \n",

It is a book that deals heavily with philosophical and religious ideas, and at times I found the philosophical component of the book to be both burdensome and boring. The story of a boy in search of a treasure he dreams about and which takes him across the desert and to the Pyrimads of Egypt I found quite moving and the best part of the book, but this journey is loaded with so much philosophy and how 'one'... a single human or plant or fossil... is united with the rest of the world is just a little too much for me.\n  \n",

The philosophy is very ego centric --there is some \"personal journey\" every man must complete, and \"the universe\" wants you to complete yours. (Unless you're female, then you should wait for your man.) There is nothing about service to others except to make money: life for this author is just about following your dreams and having adventures. (No one has children in this novel--or if they do, they are of no consequence.) There are many references to Jesus, Christianity, and Islam, but ironically nearly all of the references to Christianity are ego centric--for example, a story of how Saul's father is so proud that his son's words are remembered. Those words were about Christ--but the author cares nothing about actually trying to understand Jesus or Mohammed or anyone. Just listen to your heart. It's objectivism with a mystical veneer over top so the self centeredness can appear spiritual rather than just self centered.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    This was an interesting read despite the headline. It turned out to be a reasonably engrossing look into the intellectual and spiritual enlightenment of a young man, referred to throughout the story only as \"the boy\". He finds himself somewhat inexplicably drawn into a quest from his Spanish home across the Sahara desert in pursuit of his \"personal legend\". Needless to say, along the way he meets many interesting, even extraordinary people, while also finding himself in dangerous and trying circumstances that test his will to continue the journey. Nonetheless, he finds the love of his life who, despite her desires to keep him close, encourages him to continue.Perhaps the title is a bit misleading because the story, in the end, has very little to do with the life of an \"alchemist\", as much as it has to do with \"the boy\" who encounters him, and how he receives guidance and encouragement. In any case, I think anyone of any faith who can read with an open mind, will find this an uplifting tale of personal trials and tribulations in pursuit of an unquenchable desire to discover one's own \"meaning of life\".\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    First of all, a star docked for the writing. It sounds like it was written by a 10 year old and though this simple, parable-like prose makes the story easily accessible, it was genuinely painful to read at times for me.Another docked because Santiago is an idiot. He makes a terrible deal with a gypsy that costs him a tenth of his treasure, has his money stolen almost immediately after arriving in Africa, and apparently falls in love with every woman he meets in his life. Is Santiago made this way to represent the way people stumble around blind in life when pursuing their own dreams? Maybe, but that doesn't make him as a character any less infuriating, even though he does become a wide idiot by the end.That out of the way, this book isn't as bad as some say, or as good as some say. The truth lies in the middle, perhaps because this story is deceptive in its tale and, I believe, is so on purpose. It emphasizes dreams, or your Personal Legend, but also emphasizes the importance of living in the present and learning from your experiences. The Englishman taught Santiago about alchemists, but is ultimately less prepared when they actually meet him because he is living in his books and not the present.Additionally, the book presents an actual treasure at the pyramids as Santiago's Personal Legend, but we learn at the end that there is no treasure at the pyramids (even though he does find a physical treasure). In this, the book is deceptive yet again! The actual treasure for Santiago are the experiences he has while on his journey to the pyramids, the people he met and the wisdom he gained. For this will guide him better in life than the treasure under his sycamore tree (he is likely to have this soon stolen anyway, if his last experiences repeat).This book is ultimately deceptively wise, but only if you are able to peel through the terrible prose, mysticism and religious thinking. I would also add that you do not need to subject yourself to this tiresome tale to gain the wisdom it preaches, and that due to its deceptiveness some may only take away \"Follow your dreams and the universe will conspire to aid you\" from it.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    A simple coming-of-age parable which, by means of its straightforward style, achieves profundity. This book has been touted for years. Several friends have declared this their favorite book; a co-worker recommended that I read it; online book forums can\u2019t get through a recommendations thread without The Alchemist among the top responses. I figured it would be difficult for the book to make a true impression because of how highly touted it has been. I was wrong. I am impressed.This book drips with wisdom and yet is so unassuming that the reader is welcomed to embrace what rings true and shrug off the rest. The Alchemist tells the story of a shepherd who leaves his flocks to follow a dream of great treasure at the pyramids in Egypt. In his wanderings, he remains open to whatever experience comes his way. He meets a cast of fascinating, fun characters who share their wisdom, experience, and misadventures with the young shepherd.The writing style is simple, the translation beautiful. The prose is poetic yet approachable. As the story progresses, a reader can\u2019t help but listen to the simple wisdom on offer. I enjoyed nearly every page of this book and was satisfied with the story\u2019s full-circle conclusion. I felt that I learned and grew alongside this peripatetic shepherd; I maintained an open heart ready to welcome all wisdom, even from unexpected people and places.A few tidbits that particularly stood out:  -\u201cI couldn\u2019t have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise\u201d (13). A perfect example of the sort of wisdom this book offers. This rings true for me as I have a graduate degree from a seminary and a few weeks of wilderness backpacking under my belt. The sunset and a rock to sit on after a long day of schlepping have a deep theology on offer which couldn\u2019t be contained in the many books I\u2019ve read on the topic of spirituality.  -\u201cWe are afraid of losing what we have, whether it\u2019s our life or our possessions and property. But this fewar evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand\u201d (79). As an agnostic with an education and history of biblical studies, this sort of welcoming, simple wisdom is encouraging. Coelho doesn\u2019t ask you to convert to his philosophy, but simply to engage.  -\u201cYou will never be able to escape from your heart. So it\u2019s better to listen to what it has to say. That way you\u2019ll never have to fear an unanticipated blow\u201d (134). This is a main theme: listen to your heart, keep your eyes open to the world, remain present in your experiences, welcome omens as guideposts, avoid artificial absolutes. The shepherd in this passage goes on to confess that his heart is afraid of suffering. His friend the alchemist responds, \u201cTell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second\u2019s encounter with God and with eternity\u201d (134). What a beautiful message that strikes me at a perfect time. I am hoping to pursue my heart\u2019s dream of writing. \u201cFrom then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far from his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy swore that , every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its message\u201d (136).  -\u201cWhen we strive to become better an we are, everything around us becomes better, too...when we love, we always strive to become better than we are\u201d (155).This is a beautiful book that I will treasure, recommend, and re-read.A\n  \n",

I read the first several pages and was like, \"Well, this is an easy, simple little tale,\" but it wasn't all that appealing to me, so I marked my page, set the book down, and read a different book. Now, the magic comes here: while reading the other book (which was good) I was plagued by something I had read in the first several pages of The Alchemist, and the very fact alone that I was being haunted by words from a book I had labeled as a \"simple little tale\" told me that I really had no choice but to read it, after all, we must \"listen to our heart,\" right?So I read it- I read it, and I loved it. Then I read it again. And I still loved it. I loved it because it spoke to me on a soul level, and because for such a \"simple little tale\" it is filled to the brim with a deepness that, though simple, may be a lifetime in getting to the bottom of.\n  \n",

I'm still holding that giant crystal and haven't felt anything from it in 25 years. It was like a 4th grade version of Conversations with God meets A Course in Miracles edited by L Ron Hubbard. The worst was I felt like I was supposed to like it after hearing so many rave reviews. Reading this book was like experimenting with Quaaludes in the 80's.

Being that said I would like to mention something that is not mentioned in this book at all. Never forget about survival of the fittest. You can't be good to everybody and not everything will come in 'omens' are fallen from the sky.That's why I said at the beginning don't take the whole book literally. I mostly liked it because of some good quotes it has. My most favorite one is: \"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity.\" Very powerful and inspiring. I was surprised this quote wasn't even amongst the most highlighted ones.For those who really didn't like the book all I can say is don't take it too literally and read the foreword first.\n  \n",

I just could not get into it. The writing is so basic. The story is just mildly compelling. I got to the part where he met Melchizedez, the king, and then I just couldn\u2019t read anymore. Kept putting the book down and sighing with boredom. This book is hugely overrated! (I realize the story might have picked up and gotten better if I had kept reading, but I just couldn\u2019t. I think if I was a 12-year-old I might have liked it, though.)There were a couple moments were I liked the way the author turned a phrase or I appreciated an insight that the author had.

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    We are told how people perish for a lack of vision/ goal/ dream/Personal Legend, where themagnitude of the dream is irrelevant. However, what's imperative is that a person possessesone. Why do I say this? Because dreams are the language of God. We're all placed herewith a purpose and Personal Legend (what we've always wanted to accomplish), with ouronly real obligation being to realize our destiny. However, as with all things, to whom muchis given, much is required. There is a process that one must endure before attaining theirdream. The important thing to do is to start, which always entails choices. We mustdecide, whether we're going to continue with what we've been accustomed to (stay in ourcomfort zone) or pursue what it is that we really want (expand our territory). The way onethinks always plays an integral part in the process as well. We can either view ourselves asa poor victim or an adventurer on a quest. There are other contingencies involved aswell. However, the thing I do know is that when a person really desires something, all theuniverse conspires to help that person realize his/her dream. God has prepared a path foreach to follow, and everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits them. In order to find thetreasure we must realize that the only thing holding us back is ourselves , as wells as readand follow the signs/omens left for us.If you're reading this review, I'm sure that you have a dream that's close to your heart or onethat has been deferred, or buried. Well, now is the time to exhume that dream, dust it off,and remove it from the shelf. One of the signs that the Creator often gives us beforeembarking on a great task is a messenger. Well, in this case the messenger is Paulo Coehlo,with his book entitled, The Alchemist, being the Magnus Opus. The book is simple, yetbrilliant as it tells the story of a young man in the quest of his dream. It explains theobstacles that inevitably obstruct one's path, and the requisite qualities to face and pursueour dreams, as well as the qualities developed when following our dream to the end. Fromtime immemorial some of the most sublime truths have been communicated to man viamyth/ allegories, with The Alchemist being no different. It is chock full of spiritual andpractical gems that can be applied to our everyday life. The journey in the book is muchlike an initiation, where one is constantly subjected to tests of patience and courage. It willremind you that in pursuing one's Personal Legend, it's not about the destination, butlessons accumulated throughout the journey, that we don't have yesterday or tomorrow,only today, how life is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend, the importanceof simplicity, listening to your heart because that's where your treasure is,how the people who love you will never stand in the way of your dream, and that if theCreator brought you to it, He'll bring through it because everything under the sun has beenwritten by One hand. When one is traveling to the promised land, it's inevitable to take adetour through the desert. However, on this particular trip we have Paulo Coehloconducting us each step of the way. So if you're ready to start on or resume the journeytowards your dream/ Personal Legend, I highly recommend picking up a copy of TheAlchemist. This book contains something for everyone from high school on up. The onlything left is to observe the signs, rise, follow your conductor, and fear no danger!Maktub\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The Alchemist is a book full of integrity, determination, and fulfilling one\u2019s dreams. In this book, the main character is overcome with the desire to set out to find his destiny, or his own Personal Legend, that supposedly lies within pyramids- all while leaving behind his simple life as a shepherd. Throughout his journey he is confronted with obstacles and delays, both physical and mental. He displays much internal conflict and doubt, yet always regains his footing with the help of his faith and the always truthful omens reoccuring in his life. In this book, the author guides the plot with a series of omens and spiritual occurrences that aid Santiago, the main character. The Alchemist is written in a very simple manner, and does not express complex diction. In this way, it is a very easy read. Although some may approach that as a negative aspect of this book, it actually assists the reader to more easily understand the symbols and the spiritual meanings that occur throughout the book. The simple diction and the simple syntax helps clarify the underlying messages and themes of the book rather than having the reader anguish over the true meaning. Even with the simplicity of this book, it is written in an extremely elegant way. Paulo Coelho writes in such a vivid manner and creates very smooth, appealing imagery that makes anyone reading this book physically unable to close the book and set it down. Coelho\u2019s skills in the imagery department are very developed as he was able to write in such a way that through simple descriptions, a sense of self was provoked and appealed to not only every human sense, but to every human emotion. The book is centered around Santiago\u2019s journey, which is the main theme of the book: one must always follow their dreams. Although, the Alchemist does a wonderful job at conveying many underlying messages. The book teaches helpful universal messages such as it is wise to listen to nature as well as oneself, and to always have faith in oneself and what one believes in. The Alchemist is an absolutely wonderfully written book that provokes the readers who truly read it with passion and emotion. It is a book that contains a large amount of religious content, but it speaks spiritually to any and all who read it and it teaches a vast amount of valuable life lessons.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The Alchemist sat on my bookshelf for much too long! I wish I had read it sooner.It is a delightful story about a young man who starts out studying to become a Priest. However, he decides that is not what he really wants to be, and he becomes a shepherd. After a few years he finds himself on a quest to find his own personal legend (destiny).Through a series of events, including meeting a king who encourages him to follow his heart. That included a trip to northern Africa, spending several months working in small crystal shop (where he helps the owner become successful) in order to earn enough money for a trip to Egypt, riding in a caravan to an oasis (where he meets a woman and they fall in love), meeting an Alchemist who helps him determine and find his destiny), and reaching the Egyptian Pyramids, where he thought he would find a treasure and his Personal Legend.Through this journey he learns much about himself and others. He learns to interpret omens (much like intuition) that guide him in reaching the highest level of understanding.  He also learns that the treasure he was seeking was to be found in a place where he was originally happy as a shepherd, home in his own country.  He learned it's not the destiny that was important, but what he learned on this journey.This is one of the best books I have read dealing with how one can seize opportunities when they come your way, and by not fearing the unknown, trusting in yourself to overcome adversity, one can succeed on levels beyond what might never have been possible. It is a way to find a better understanding of yourself and your real goal, and through this journey you allow yourself the opportunity to reach your own destiny -- Personal Legend.I wish I had read it in my younger years.  I would then have had the opportunity to seize the moments when they came about.  I might even have become that famous doctor I had dreamed about as a teen.Do seize the opportunity to read this book by Paulo Coelho! I did, and I find myself looking at things through different eyes, and reflecting on my own destiny.\n  \n",

It is an adventure - a quest - with the over-arching theme that everything is connected, and all people are connected. The author's storytelling style keeps the protagonist at arm's length (I don't know the accurate phrase), so we vaguely empathize with him without becoming emotionally attached. The story goes in a circle with no real beginning or end, like the world it describes. There is an excellent message here, worth visiting and re-visiting.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    It was like this book came into my life at the perfect time, kinda like how this novel talks about when you finally decide to go after your \"Personal Legend\" (your life's dream) the Universe conspires to put people and circumstances in your life to help you achieve your \"Personal Legend\".  After years of working in a factory I made a decision last year to do something more meaningful with my life. So I started devouring personal development books including alot of Napoleon Hill. Hill stresses the importance of having a Definite Chief Aim in life (same as Personal Legend) and he also talked about how once you have a clear destination the Universe will put people and circumstances in your life to aid you.  Now, I read alot of bad reviews on tbis book. I believe that the people who didn't like this book were either not ready for the message (which one year ago I doubt  I would of been ready to understand the message myself), or they just have a very strict perspective on life, and how the world is just random occurrences.  So if you are open to look at life in a different way, or have any prior experience with personal development books you will LOVE this book. It is really easy to read, Paulo Coelho doesn't over describe everything in his books, which makes it a faster read, and let's the reader's imagination make up the details as they want. This is one of the most powerful personal development books in a wonderful and inspiring story. I was giving this book by a friend and read it three times, then ordered a copy for my 13 year old daughter. I think this book is so powerful they should make this required reading in high school!\n  \n",

'The Alchemist' led me to understand the last six months of my life. Consider three quotes from the book.\"'The mysterious force... appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your Personal Legend.'\"'We could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men.\"\"'Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and wars.'\"The author of those lines led me to understand that I had served as a mysterious force to the Personal Legend of a priestess.\"I had tied my heart to the side of a donkey and sent it into a secret valley between Katmandu and Timbuktu. It told me that a woman in the valley was growing into a role of spiritual leadership. So I entered.\"I met the woman. Her name is Narmis. I met the baker, the cobbler, the smith, the stable boys and girls and many other delightful folks. From the corner of my eye, I occasionally caught a glimpse of their rainbow auras.\"A week later, Narmis built a small temple. She erected the sacristy around the trunk of a sycamore. Every day she nailed a new installment of holy scripture to the wooden door at the front of the temple. I memorized one of them as a guidebook for the rest of my life.\"Narmis needed a mysterious force to spur her ministry.\"First I became a mirror. I reflected the depth of her wisdom back to her. She grew more self-assured.\"Second I performed a miracle. On the alter I held my hand over her heart. A terrible pain in her legs and hips diminished. She felt a physical echo of the healing in her heart. In truth she performed her own miracle through a faith I helped her to achieve.\"Third I whispered secrets in her ear. She feared her own power. Power corrupts. She wanted to remain pure. She wanted to tolerate only purity among her followers.\"Her disciples hid their impurities well. But the further you went from the temple, the more trouble you found in the valley. Pickpockets teemed in the market. Burglars invaded homes. Lustful moans escaped the brothel.\"I whispered that she must minister to even the worst of the sorry lot. Even some of the idolaters fashioning a golden calf could mend their ways. She must find the courage to pursue power without corrupting her soul. She must hypnotize the people with wisdom, compassion and beauty.\"Narmis pushed me from the sacristy. Her hands never touched me and her words remained kind, but her eyes clouded with anger. I fell back. I ran from the temple. I saddled up and left the valley, crying.\"Only after reading Paulo Coelho's masterpiece did I understand. My presence among the people of the secret valley served a purpose. I love them still, but I cannot go back. My absence serves an even higher purpose. The priestess shall have no crutch. She will pursue her Personal Legend or she will not.\"Hegel wrote, \"The owl of Minerva spreads her wings only with the coming of dusk.\" Coelho offers more wisdom than Hegel through the simple speech of Santiago, the shepherd boy.\"And me? My owl spread her wings in the tearful days following my fall from grace. I learned to tie my heart to the owl at night and to a falcon in the day. No more donkey rides. My heart now soars to places of great joy. I recite the holy scripture without hesitation. Narmis helped me find the faith to heal.\"\n  \n",

My son (who's slightly autistic) is now reading it and having his mind blown. It's worth the purchase; don't just get it from your local library.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    I just finished the Alchemist, and now I know why many people love this book. It is hard to describe. It is deceptively simple, with much more going on than appears on the surface. I liked the way the author interweaves much from world religions, but I mostly I liked the bits included from my own religion. (Christianity)... One thing I must admit though.... This left me wishing I was one of the first readers of this story, instead of possibly the last man on earth who hadn\u2019t. I must admit that I had EXTREMELY high expectations for the book, since I heard and read over and over and over that it was \u201c...one of my favorites\u201d....or...\u201d...one of the greatest books of the 20th century..\u201d, etc etc ... It set up my reading for the inevitable let down that comes from anything that has been built up to \u201cthe second coming of Christ\u201d. (i.e... movies, vacation, Christmas morning, etc). I DO feel like it is one I\u2019ll read again sometime, to try to catch more hidden gems and bits of treasure the author has hidden in the story. So, I must say, for me to want to Reread any book.... THAT is saying something. So it MUST be a special work.\n  \n",

It was Christmas day, 2016 when my wife and I came across \"The Alchemist\" in the Kindle store and decided it would be a good book to read together. It did not disappoint.\"The Alchemist\" reads like a fairy tail or a mythic legend. It's a delightful read with iconic characters and classic lessons of Western mysticism sprinkled throughout. For anyone who is familiar with the teachings of the Rosicrucian style mystery schools, this story will be a refreshing reminder of the truths we hold most dear. For those who haven't had any exposure to that brand of spirituality, you will find in \"The Alchemist\" a parable that may bring some clarity and direction into your life.I can especially recommend this book for teens and young adults. People at that age are still trying to find their world view and the lessons in this book may make their search easier and more fruitful.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is a very interesting book that explores many concepts in life, such as personal legends, travel, love, and belief. Through these concepts, the reader is opened up to new ideas and perspectives all while the main character,Santiago is too. I personally feel that this book has taught me a little bit more about life through quotes from the secondary characters who guide Santiago through the story. For example, \u201cto realize one\u2019s destiny is a person's only obligation,\u201d was said by the alchemist and it made me realize that this idea actually applies to real life, because once someone realizes their destiny, they will always fulfill that destiny and succeed in life. One thing that Coelho does very well in this book is the character development and interactions. Santiago, the main character is introduced in the beginning of the book as a curious shepherd who wants to explore the world. He is a very dynamic character, so throughout the story, he learns lessons about himself or the world that make him wiser. An interesting thing that Coelho does is throughout the book, Santiago encounters many different people and each time this happens, he becomes wiser and more experienced. For example, Santiago encounters a gypsy in the beginning of the book who helps him realize his \u201cpersonal legend\u201d/destiny, then he meets a king who convinces him to follow that personal legend and why every man should. He also meets a girl who exposes him to love and an alchemist who shows him the ways of alchemy. Santiago\u2019s dynamic character and his guides and teachers are a very strong aspect of this book. Throughout the book, Santiago and other characters bring up the term \u201cpersonal legend\u201d repeatedly to remind the reader of the main focus of the story. Personal legend is almost the same thing as a destiny. Everybody has a personal legend. Because the author chose Santiago\u2019s personal legend as the main focus, the reader is able to connect with and learn about Santiago more than they would with other fictional characters. Coelho choses an adventure that is very personal to the main character for this very reason. As well as telling a story, Coelho tries to tell the reader something with his repetition of the term \u201cpersonal legend\u201d and the constant in depth conversations and thoughts about it throughout the book. By going in depth to what it means and repeating it so much, the reader starts to realize that they too must have a personal legend and follow it as Santiago did. Overall, this book is very well structured and has many great aspects about it with little to no flaws. The character structure, plot development, and connection from book to reader is amazingly done by the author, Paulo Coelho.\n  \n",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    An interesting parable on life, this story takes us on a modern journey with ageless life lessons.  A shepherd boy living in Andulisia meets up with a mystical figure Mechizedek, who represents himself as the King of Salem.  The obvious reference here is the Melchizedek of ancient Biblical fame, to whom homage and tithes were paid.  He was a prophet and a high priest, and in this story he fulfils those roles for this young shepherd.  It seems that the lad needed to find his own story and find his life message, which takes him on a journey to North Africa to search out his treasure which he is led to believe is at the site of the Egyptian pyramids.  He is robbed, he has to give up treasures, he meets with a person who is searching for how to make gold from other metals ( thus the alchemist title).  In all of these wanderings, he discovers love, treasure and life lessons, the most apparent of these lessons is this: \"follow your heart, for where your heart is, your treasure is also\".  The Biblical theme in this story is woven throughout the characters and events in an interesting and pleasant fashion, making this a fun read.\n  \n",
